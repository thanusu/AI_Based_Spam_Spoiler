Whatever the risk was prior should not matter. Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset. If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted. Phillip"

Normal,"Dear Eric, We scored a major victory for election integrity this past Sunday when Florida certified the election results in George W. Bush's favor. I want to thank you for being one of the 325,000 plus Americans who joined the petition campaign at ElectionIntegrity2000.com to ""Certify the Bush Victory."" Unfortunately, Al Gore has flatly refused to accept the fair and just election results. Instead, he is pursuing a calculated course of action intended to overturn the will of the voters and the CERTIFIED election results. Included in these actions are his attempts to attack and discredit military absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while simultaneously using manipulative ""hand-counting"" techniques to convert so-called ""dimpled chads"" into votes for Gore. This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf. What Gore is doing is WRONG. And every day that he continues to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers a clear majority of American citizens. That's why Election Integrity 2000 has started up a new campaign to collect online letters and send them to Al Gore urging him to concede the election NOW! Al Gore always claims to be ""listening to the will of the people."" The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to hear from us in a big way. But just in case this isn't enough, we'll also be sending daily press releases to the leaders in the House and Senate as well as the major news media informing them about the overwhelming response we are receiving from American people demanding that Al Gore concede. Eric, this is a personalized message just for you. Please go to the link at the bottom of this message to sign your letter to Al Gore. Do NOT forward this e-mail. In the couple of hours, I'll send you another e-mail for you to forward to every friend who might be interested in sending a message to Al Gore that America wants him to concede. For Election Integrity, Bruce Eberle PERSONALIZED LINK AOL FRIENDLY: <A er to Al Gore</A> If you would like to unsubscribe from Election Integrity 2000 e-mail updates or change your e-mail address, please visit our web site at: AOL Users: <A subscribe or Change E-mail</A>"

Latest NBA Player News Tyrone Nesby , F LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 The Washington Wizards acquired Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday for forwards Cherokee Parks and Obinna Ekezie, both of whom came to the Wizards in an August 22 deal for center Isaac Austin. Nesby, who was third on the Clippers in scoring at 7.7 ppg, should immediately assume the small forward position for Washington. Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/28/00 Geiger has been diagnosed with developing tendinitis in his right thigh, less than one week since he returned to action after undergoing knee surgery in the offseason. The Sixers' center is listed as day to day. For those Fantasy owners who grabbed Geiger upon his return, it is time to put him on the shelf once again until he is healthy. Erick Dampier , C GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/28/00 Dampier didn't practice on Monday because of soreness in his left knee. He has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 10.4 points and 7.2 rebounds per game for Golden State. Despite his condition, he is expected to play against the Clippers on Wednesday night. Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 Barros will likely be activated off the injured list in time for Wednesday's game against the Nets. He will replace Cedric Ceballos, who was traded to Miami, on the Pistons' roster. Barros likely won't see enough playing time to be very productive, so his Fantasy value is very slim. Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 With the addition of Joe Smith, the Pistons are now reportedly shopping Williams. The Detroit Free Press is reporting that Detroit is talking to the Los Angeles Clippers about a deal that would involve Williams and both Corey Maggette and Tyrone Nesby. Williams has been a decent Fantasy player thus far, averaging 7.8 points and 8.4 rebounds over his first 14 games. A trade to the Clippers would increase Williams' Fantasy value, so you may want to consider him for your roster if the deal becomes a reality. Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/28/00 Miami Heat Head Coach Pat Riley plans to give Ceballos a course in motivation, adding that he wants the veteran forward to re-capture his scoring touch to help Miami get back on the winning track. ""If he gets his mindset back to really being what he was last year and even a couple of years ago - that he is a real valued member of a rotation and is needed - that will inspire him,"" said Riley. If Riley's tactics work, Ceballos' Fantasy value could rise significantly, so keep your eyes on the box scores over the next few days. Jonathan Kerner , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 Kerner, who had missed all 14 of the Knicks' games this season, was waived by the team on Monday. He has been hampered by patella tendinitis in his right knee, and became expendable when the Knicks signed guard Rick Brunson. Kerner was of no Fantasy value. Rick Brunson , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 Brunson was signed by the Knicks on Monday, replacing the injured Charlie Ward on the roster. Brunson appeared in 54 games for New York from 1998-2000. He was signed as a free agent by the Celtics this season but was waived on Nov. 21. He averaged only 3.7 points and 3.4 assists in 20.3 minutes per game in Boston. Brunson's numbers likely won't improve with the Knicks, so don't waste a roster spot in him. Stromile Swift , G VAN - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 Swift is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks after suffering an ankle injury. He hasn't been too productive lately since being removed from the regular frontcourt rotation. Kevin Edwards , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Edwards is suffering from a thumb injury and is questionable for Monday's road game against the Knicks. If he is unable to play Doug West will probably start at shooting guard. Jason Collier , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Collier is expected to be sidelined three to four weeks with torn cartilage in his right knee and will undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday morning. With reserves Collier and Kelvin Cato injured, the Rockets will now have to search for a backup for C Hakeem Olajuwon. Baron Davis , G CHA - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 Davis was named the NBA's Player of the Week by the league on Monday. He averaged 12.5 points, 10.5 assists and 8.8 rebounds per game in leading the Hornets to a 4-0 week. Davis is turning out to be a real Fantasy star early in the season, so be sure to pick him up if he is still available in your league. Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/27/00 Carter will be sidelined for at least the next two games after suffering an injured knee tendon on Sunday against the Bulls. He won't travel with the team this week as they head to the road to face both Dallas and Washington. With only three games on the slate for Toronto, make room on your bench for Carter until he is healthy. Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/27/00 Sprewell will replace the injured Charlie Ward at the point guard position in Monday's game against Vancouver. In what has been called the ""big backcourt,"" Sprewell would play the one while Allan Houston remains the shooting guard. Sprewell's numbers should remain the same at worst, but he could see a slight increase in scoring if he can post up smaller point guards. Glen Rice , G NY - The Rounders Updated 11/27/00 Rice will get the start at small forward in Monday night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies. The move was made in an effort to halt the Knicks' two-game losing streak while also giving the offense some much needed scoring punch. Look for Rice's production to increase as a result of the lineup change. Marcus Fizer , F CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Fizer missed Sunday's game against the Raptors with a sprained right ankle. He had been receiving treatment for the injury in an effort to play, but felt that he would do the team more harm than good by playing. Despite the injury, Fizer expects to return to practice on Monday. With the success of so many forwards in the league this season, Fizer has lost some of his Fantasy value. He isn't a viable Fantasy option as of right now, but owners in deeper leagues could do worse than keeping Fizer on their roster. Doug Overton , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Overton sprained his right ankle during Sunday's loss to the Grizzlies. He sustained the injury while chasing down a lose ball in the fourth quarter. Overton, who was signed by the Celtics last week, is of little Fantasy value in most leagues. His availability for Tuesday's game against the Cavaliers is uncertain. Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Atkins sprained his left ankle in the first half of Sunday's loss to the Jazz, but returned to the game 11 minutes after halftime. X-rays on Atkins' ankle weren't required, but his status for Wednesday's game against New Jersey is still unknown. Luc Longley , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Longley was activated on Saturday after missing New York's first 14 games with a knee injury. He hasn't played since suffered the injury back on September 29 while playing for Australia in the Olympics. Unless you are desperate for a center, Longley isn't much of an option in the world of Fantasy. Felton Spencer , C NY - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Spencer was placed on the injured list after suffering a sprained right knee against Atlanta on Wednesday night. He averaged 1.8 points and 2.6 rebounds in five games, and wasn't much of a factor in most Fantasy leagues. Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/27/00 The Miami Heat, looking for help off the bench, acquired Ceballos from the Detroit Pistons on Sunday night for a conditional second-round draft choice. The Heat have been hit by injuries this season, especially at small forward. Ceballos is expected to step into a bench role expected to be filled by swingman Dan Majerle, who has missed much of the season with a torn hamstring. To make room for Ceballos, the Heat waived forward Jamal Robinson. Charlie Ward , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/26/00 Ward will have arthroscopic surgery Monday to clear loose cartilage out of his right knee. The procedure will be performed by team physician Dr. Norman Scott and Ward is expected to miss six to eight weeks. He likely will go on the injured list, with rookie forward Pete Mickeal to be activated. Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/26/00 McGrady, Orlando's leading scorer with a 22.8-point average, missed Saturday night's game against the Atlanta Hawks because of an infected left hand. The fourth-year pro was replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Mike Miller. McGrady's status is day-to-day. Anfernee Hardaway , G PHO - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/26/00 Hardaway underwent arthroscopic surgery on his ailing left knee Saturday to repair frayed cartilage. Team doctors believe the flap of cartilage was the source of irritation in the knee. Doctors also said they also treated a cyst near the rear of the knee joint. Hardaway, put on the injured list Oct. 30 before the season started, is now expected to be sidelined another 3-to-4 weeks. Jerome Kersey , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 Kersey, a veteran of 16 years in the NBA, signed Friday with the Milwaukee Bucks. He will be a valuable player off the bench for the Bucks but has no real Fantasy value. Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/25/00 Jackson, the Atlanta Hawks' leading scorer, was placed on the injured list with a sprained ligament in his right knee. DeMarr Johnson will probably start at shooting guard in his place. Besides for Mutombo, Jackson was the only Hawk putting up good Fantasy numbers consistently. Sam Perkins , F IND - Free Agent Updated 11/25/00 The Pacers placed starting center Sam Perkins on the injured list Thursday before their game against Toronto. Terry Mills was activated form the list to take Perkins' place on the roster. Jermaine O'Neal will start at center in Perkins' absence. Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/23/00 The Spurs placed Jackson on the injured list Wednesday with a sprained left ankle. He has played in just one game this season, scoring two points, and is probably not worth holding onto for your Fantasy team. Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/23/00 Payton had his team-imposed suspension lifted Wednesday, the same day it had been dished out. He played last night against San Antonio, so by all means, keep him in your active lineup. Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/23/00 Fortson had successful surgery on his broken right foot Wednesday, and will be sidelined for at least two months. He had been leading the NBA in rebounding when he suffered the injury, and was placed on the injured list November 15. His rehabilitation program will consist of an immobilization of the foot for about eight weeks, after which point he will enter the final phase of recovery. Fortson will likely not return to the Warriors until after the All-Star break. More Updates Copyright 2000 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc. Your site is always at BK10SP"

Bush News 11/28/00 http://www.georgewbush.com Contents: 1 Talking Points to Set the Record Straight 2 Statement by Secretary James A. Baker, III 3 What They're Saying... 1 TALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT MYTH: There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have never been counted. BOIES: ""[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been counted once for the presidency of the United States."" [Today Show, 11/27/00] FACT: ~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once on election night and again during the automatic recount. ~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in every race on the ballot, including races for President. ~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho, 3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President. ~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing) about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade. These ballots were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for President. ~ This reality reflects common sense: a voter may want to vote for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be undecided about the choice for President. In particular, a voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable with his or her party's choice for President and yet unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate. So he or she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for President. MYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been counted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead by 9 votes. FACT: ~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of the certified votes from Nassau County. ~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature. ~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme Court's deadline. ~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not proceeding with a manual recount. ~ The 157 ""interim gain"" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a selective recount of the most Democrat precincts. Gore won these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%. It would be unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican precincts, too. Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters, favored Bush. The Gore approach would treat these minorities in a discriminatory fashion. ~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and federal law should be counted. Counties recognized this and counted them. Even Joe Lieberman said that such military ballots should not be rejected. MYTH: Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not for the Republican ""mob"" that ""intimidated"" the canvassing board. KLAIN: ""We think already almost 160 votes were counted in Dade County before the mob stopped the count... But I think that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a count, and then that's going to provide the end because a partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the kind of end that we have to American elections."" [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00] FACT: ~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit the recount to only a select set of the votes. ~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd. ~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints, and did not even instruct the crowd to desist. The crowd was quieted promptly. MYTH: In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by adding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by the board as illegal. FACT: ~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from the rest, and not counted. As a result, Bush received 124 fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election night. ~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it. Because the Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the count to make it accurate. ~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to certify the original election night count - which included the 218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which mistakenly omitted those ballots). 2 STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III Ladies and Gentlemen, Regrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit contesting the certified election results in Florida. Their aim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of counts and recounts. As I said last night, America has never had a presidential election decided by a contest of the election outcome in court. This is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new, uncertain, and controversial territory. Therefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of the litigation team who will be defending the vote of Floridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney. I have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee, Florida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig. Mr. Richard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of Florida, has 33 years of trial experience. Other members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of the law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois. Together they bring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys. The other two members of our senior litigation team are law partners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas. Together, Daryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience practicing in court. These five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the overall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on four issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize. 3 WHAT THEY'RE SAYING... Quotes from Democrats: ""It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last legal limit to get the election...I don't think he should."" - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin; Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00 U.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, will vote for Texas Gov. George W. Bush if the presidential race is ultimately decided by the U.S. House of Representatives. ""I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth Congressional District voted. And in this case, Governor Bush carried [my district]."" - The (Mississippi) Sun Herald, 11/28/00 Monday, Indiana House Speaker John Gregg, D-Sandborn, called on Gore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election in doubt for 20 days. ""He needs to pick up the phone, call Austin and say, 'Mr. President, congratulations. I support you as president 100 percent."" - Indianapolis Star, 11/26/00 Self-described liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBC's ""Hardball with Chris Matthews,"" 11/27/00: ""They're talking about 26,000 people that they said their votes didn't count. There are 35,000 other people in Florida who's votes were not counted that lie in George Bush country...Many, many more are Bush votes and they don't say a word about that."" Quotes from Media: Peggy Noonan on Fox News Channel's ""Hannity and Colmes,"" 11/27/00: ""...a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without having that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of thought and logic and argument... ""You cannot say of the ballot, just because nobody voted for Bush or Gore, that it's really a secret Gore vote that didn't get counted..."" Salon.com's Joan Walsh, 11/28/00: ""His condescending, singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday night was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was almost insulting."" Don Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBC's ""Imus in the Morning,"" 11/28/00: Imus: ""What if Gore had won, and Bush...I mean, what if the roles were reversed, how would, I wouldn't want to include you in this, but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be treating all this if the roles were reversed."" Fineman: ""Oh my God, ...you kidding?! That George Bush was a cry baby, that he was the spoiled son of a failed President. You know, you can just here it. The personal attacks on Bush would be just absolutely vicious."" Ceci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC, 11/27/00: Connolly: ""But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore, that you sometimes get, that has turned off many Americans over time. And you also got a little bit of whining, frankly, when he started talking about voter intimidation."" Reid: ""Some thought it very odd, why they had all the photographers in there flashing. It was a bit distracting. And the flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags. And another question: a very formal setting for a very personal conversation with the American people."" Howard Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00: Fineman: ""He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was something about him, some essential goodness in him, that made it worth fighting this fight. And when he said, 'If I lose, so be it,' he had to be convincing on that point. And I must say, after all the arguing in this very divided election, it's going to be hard for most Americans to agree with that... ""...most Americans think that this election was fair. He's got to make the case that it isn't, and it's hard for him to do it. ""...political terms, I'm not sure how much time he really has...""

Latest NFL Player News Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 11/28/00 Connell's status for Sunday's game against the Giants is seriously in doubt. He sprained his knee in last week's game against the Eagles, and Head Coach Norv Turner has already stated that Connell will not start. This should serve notice to Fantasy owners who have Connell on their roster not to put him in their lineup this week. Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 Head Coach Norv Turner has stated that Fryar will get the start this week against the Giants. He had four catches for 50 yards in last week's loss to the Eagles, and could see extended playing time if Albert Connell is unable to play for the 'Skins. Fryar isn't the type of receiver you want to depend on for production, especially with the Fantasy league playoffs looming. Consider another option if your roster allows it. James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 The Washington wideout caught five passes for 121 yards and a touchdown in last Sunday's loss to the Eagles. He seemed to thrive with Jeff George under center, but now that Brad Johnson is back from injury, it may be a return to mediocrity. Thrash could, however, see some looks this week if Albert Connell's knee injury keeps him from playing extended minutes. Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 Harris sprained his left knee in last week's loss to the Vikings. However, the injury shouldn't keep Harris from playing this week as Dallas travels to Tampa Bay to face the Buccaneers. After a fast start, Harris has really been quieted by opposing defenses in recent weeks. He is a good backup tight end in most Fantasy leagues, but his inconsistent numbers keep him from being an every week starter. Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/28/00 The Doomsday Defense has now become The M.A.S.H. unit. The Cowboys lost yet another player on Monday when defensive end Peppi Zellner tore his ACL in practice, effectively ending his season. Zellner now joins Leon Lett (knee), George Teague (foot), Chad Hennings (neck) and Darren Woodson (arm) on the long list of defensive players who have been injured this season. Only Woodson is still available to the team, but his status for this week's game at Tampa Bay is still uncertain. With all of the injuries on defense coupled with a brutal final four weeks of the season, it would be a good idea to drop Dallas' unit before the playoffs. Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/28/00 Smith, who suffered a concussion on Thanksgiving Day against the Vikings, is expected to start this Sunday at Tampa Bay. He was held out of practice on Monday for precautionary reasons but will return to the field for Dallas' first full practice of the week on Wednesday. Dallas is likely to give Smith the ball quite a bit on Sunday, as they attempt to establish the run against a tough Bucs' defense. Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/28/00 Head Coach Norv Turner has indicated that Davis should be ready to play in this week's pivotal NFC East matchup against the Giants. Davis missed last week's game against the Eagles with a hairline fracture of his right forearm. The return of Davis is great news for Fantasy players who own his rights, especially with the playoffs just around the corner. Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 11/28/00 It's official - Rams Coach Mike Martz has announced that Warner will be his starting quarterback against Carolina on Sunday. This is good news for Fantasy owners of Rams players, as the team is a lot stronger offensively when Warner is taking the snaps. Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 Price caught six passes for 44 yards in Sunday's loss to the Buccaneers. He has been a major disappointment this season to Fantasy owners who took a chance on him. In fact, Price hasn't caught a touchdown pass since Week One against the Titans. Unless you are involved in a deep league, look elsewhere for a reserve wideout. Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Riemersma caught five passes for 82 yards in Sunday's 31-17 loss to the Buccaneers. Although he may not post solid numbers every week, his production is consistent enough to warrant a starting spot in many Fantasy leagues. Keep Riemersma on you roster as the playoffs approach. Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 The Bengals have upgraded Mitchell's condition from questionable to probable for next Sunday's game against Arizona. Coach Dick LeBeau has not yet named his starter for that game, although Mitchell would give the Cincinnati offense its best shot at solid Fantasy numbers. Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Smith completed 10 of 20 passes for 129 yards and a touchdown Sunday against Pittsburgh, and the Bengals applauded his efforts in the game. His teammates said he was as sharp and confident on the field as he's been all season. Coach Dick LeBeau hasn't yet named his starter for next Sunday, although we wouldn't recommend either Cincinnati quarterback at this stage of the Fantasy season. Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 Moulds had a huge day against the Bucs, catching eight passes while accounting for 122 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Look for Moulds to post good numbers this week against the Dolphins, a team who he has absolutely killed in the past. Kevin Johnson , WR CLE - Top Dogs Updated 11/27/00 Johnson led the Browns with four catches for 85 yards Sunday against Baltimore, although most of that was due to a 67-yard reception that set up a Browns touchdown on the game's first drive. He's the closest thing to a viable Fantasy starter on the Browns, although the lack of a reliable passing game will limit his value over the season's final weeks. Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Coach Chris Palmer has become increasingly frustrated with Northcutt in recent weeks, according to the Akron Beacon Journal . Northcutt has been dropping too many passes and committing costly fumbles, including one on a punt return Sunday against Baltimore. He had no catches on the day. Palmer is likely to start Northcutt the rest of the season, but he's not a recommended Fantasy receiver. Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Alexander had a productive day for Washington, catching four passes for 39 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Eagles. The 'Skins tight end hasn't been consistent at all this season, however, so use another option at the position if at all possible. Doug Pederson , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Pederson completed just eight of 16 passes for 108 yards and an interception Sunday against Baltimore before being lifted in the second quarter for backup Spergon Wynn. We don't recommend Pederson over the season's final weeks, as the Browns' offense is showing how much injuries have depleted it this year. Spergon Wynn , QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Wynn, who replaced Doug Pederson at the start of the second half of Sunday's game against Baltimore, wasn't overly successful in the 18 plays he was a part of. He completed five of nine passes, but they went for just 30 yards, and he was sacked four times, losing a fumble once. Coach Chris Palmer continues to say he wants to bring Wynn along slowly, and the Browns' offense is reeling, so don't expect much from him over the season's final weeks. Chris Redman , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Redman was called upon during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Cleveland, although he did not attempt a pass. Unless Baltimore runs away with any of its next three games, he will likely not see any more action this season. Matt Stover , K BAL - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 Stover kicked three field goals Sunday against Cleveland, breaking his single-season mark of 29 and passing the 1,000-point mark for his career. He added five extra points and now has an NFL-best 116 points on the season. Unless you hear otherwise, Stover should be a permanent fixture in your starting lineup for the remainder of the season. David Akers , K PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Akers kicked two field goals against the Redskins, including what turned out to be the game winner. He connected on boots of 33 and 30 yards, and has now kicked nine field goals in his last three games. Look for Akers' success to continue this week against the Titans, in game where the placekickers could play a major role in the final score. Jeff Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Talk about a good touchdown percentage - Thomason has caught only nine passes all year, but five have been for a touchdown. Although he does seem to get into the end zone quite a bit, don't let the numbers fool you. Unless you are in a deeper Fantasy league, Thomason won't be a reliable option when it comes time for your playoffs to begin. Sam Gash , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Gash, making his sixth start in place of injured Obafemi Ayanbadejo, had a two-yard touchdown pass in yesterday's game against Cleveland. Don't take that to mean he's a sleeper over the remainder of the season; Gash had just one other catch (for six yards) in the game and will continue to serve almost entirely as a blocker, a role he is perfectly-suited for. Shaun King , QB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/27/00 King was rather mediocre against the Bills Sunday. He completed 10-of-18 passes for 106 yards. King has now gone two consecutive games without throwing a touchdown pass. That should change this week when he faces a Dallas defense with an almost nonexistent pass rush. The Cowboys have a league worst 17 sacks this season. King's offensive line will provide him with plenty of time to pick the Cowboys' secondary apart. Ravens , DT BAL - Eric Bass Updated 11/27/00 Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and Arizona coming off the bye. Charles Johnson , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Johnson has been very unproductive over Philadelphia's last five games, compiling only only eleven catches and 94 yards receiving. None of Philadelphia's receivers, including Johnson, is worth wasting a roster spot on at this point. Look for better reserve wideouts before your playoffs begin. Torrance Small , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Small could only haul in one pass for 18 yards against the Redskins. He has been a real disappointment to Fantasy owners who took a chance on him, catching only one pass in four of his last five games. It's time to look for an alternative to Small if he is still on your roster. Tony Banks , QB BAL - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/27/00 Banks was called on during the third quarter of Sunday's game against Cleveland after it was well out of hand. He completed just two of three passes for 45 yards, but looked respectable in a reserve role. Although that's good news for the Ravens, don't read into this as a sign he'll get much, if any, playing time during Baltimore's final three games. Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 11/27/00 Johnson is struggling once again. He had just two catches for 15 yards against the Bills Sunday. After catching four TDs in three games, Johnson has just four catches in the last two. Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/00 Lewis was solid in Sunday's win over Washington, catching six passes for 53 yards in the game. He has had three consecutive productive games after a bit of a mid-season slump, and should get a number of looks this week against Tennessee. Keep him in the starting lineup as your Fantasy playoffs approach. More Updates Copyright 2000 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc. Your site is always at FB10SP"

Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 The Cowboys' defensive line played its best games of the season, sacking Redskins' quarterback Jeff George five times while limiting Stephen Davis to only 57 yards rushing. Dallas' unit, which has been ravaged by injuries, held the 'Skins to only 13 points on the afternoon and looked much more like a cohesive unit than in recent weeks. Expect the Cowboys to follow up this effort with another solid performance against the Giants, but look long and hard before giving Dallas' D the start this week. Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 With the announcement that Jeff George will remain Washington's starter for the last two games, Johnson's season and Fantasy value is all but gone. Don't be surprised to see Johnson in a new uniform come training camp. Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale. Coach Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23. Fantasy owners should look elsehwere for a Fantasy QB. Griese hasn't played in almost a month. A player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team. Jackie Harris , TE DAL - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible. Irving Fryar , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to Fantasy owners in deeper leagues. Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much as a result. James Thrash , WR WAS - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three man. Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over the final two games. Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season. Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy value at this point in the season. Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs. Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in your Fantasy season. Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to play next Sunday against Cincinnati. James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea. R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder of the season. Larry Centers , RB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/11/00 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk. Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs. Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point. Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 12/11/00 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive. Kurt Warner , QB STL - Risk Managers Updated 12/11/00 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 346 yards. Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week. If you are one of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to Fantasy glory. Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this week's game against Dallas. The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins this week. Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns. He gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards. With his performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back. Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Murder Inc. Updated 12/11/00 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday. Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams. He will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter will be up for the task. He struggled in their first meeting but still managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown. Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' quarterbacks all together. Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy value to help you at this important stage of the season. Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/11/00 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday. Look for Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week. He had six catches for 130 yards in their first meeting this season. Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham (groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' D this week. More Updates Copyright 2000 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires in Chinese November 27, 2000 Reforms in India Are Tantalizing, But Debates Cool Investor Ardor By DANNY PEARL Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL NEW DELHI, India -- The tumblers of economic reform have slowly but surely been turning in India over the past decade, each click resonating through this nation of a billion people. Lately the prospect of unlocking its markets has seemed a bit brighter -- but not bright enough to impress foreign investors. Every day, India's financial pages are filled with news of a new opening: a plan to sell the government's stake in a big car company, the lifting of controls on the textile industry. But the fine print tells another story: stubborn hurdles to foreign investment, insistence on public control and open battles among ministers that could force Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to protect his diverse coalition government rather than take fresh economic gambles. ""The debate over reforms will be endless unless there is a crisis, and there is no crisis around the corner,"" says Mahesh Vyas, executive director of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, a private organization. India is still coasting along with economic growth above 6% a year. Still, there are some worrisome signs. Last month, Standard & Poor's lowered its outlook on the Indian rupee because of the darker prospects for economic reform. Foreign investment, already a pittance compared with the rest of Asia, has slackened recently, and a few big companies, including Enron Corp. of Houston and British Telecommunications PLC, are freezing some India investments as their focus shifts to more-developed markets. Just 14% of the multinational-company executives recently surveyed by AT Kearney said they were more likely to invest in India than in China; 56% said the reverse. Even critics think Mr. Vajpayee's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which one year ago won a mandate to lead its second coalition government, is sincere about pushing for further opening of India's statist economy. But what government officials call the second generation of reforms -- India's Congress Party launched the first in the early 1990s to allow more private enterprise -- is meeting stiff domestic resistance. Workers and traditional Indian businesses are as scared of competition as ever, and the Congress Party, now in the opposition, is playing on those fears. So the government is moving in small, often contradictory steps. ""Their hearts are in the right place,"" says John Band, executive director of ASK Raymond James, an affiliate of the American investment bank. Here is how the reforms are shaping up in five critical areas. Privatization India's program of selling off government companies is still mostly talk, but much of it could come to fruition in the next few months. While the government probably won't meet its target of raising 100 billion rupees ($2.14 billion) this fiscal year, it is likely India will shed some perennial money losers. The first could be Air India and its domestic counterpart, Indian Airlines, both of which have attracted expressions of interest from foreign airlines including Air France and Singapore Airlines. Divestment Minister Arun Shourie, who isn't revealing the full list, said on the first day of the World Economic Forum's ""India Economic Summit"" in New Delhi Sunday that before proceeding to formal bids, India will reject suitors who could pose national-security concerns. India, he said, wants to avoid buyers who might shut down the beleaguered airlines and keep the lucrative landing rights. Job padding is legendary in India, so fear of job losses is real. Bank workers fired a warning shot across privatization's bow this month with a one-day, midweek strike against government banks. The next day, the government announced it was moving forward anyhow, seeking a law that would allow it to reduce its stake in public banks below 50%. The move wasn't as bold as it seemed, though: The law wouldn't actually contemplate a sale of shares and wouldn't allow any single investor to buy more than 1%. Government officials pledged to keep the ""public character"" of the banks. Supporters of divestment within Mr. Vajpayee's cabinet are few but influential. They are concentrating their efforts on a plan to sell the government's 50% stake in car maker Maruti Udyog Ltd., a joint venture of Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. and India's government. But the cabinet is divided over the sale, and Mr. Vajpayee has to keep all the members of his coalition happy, including hardline nationalists. This weekend, Mr. Shourie flew to Bombay to placate leaders of the radical Shiv Sena party who were upset about the prime minister's recent olive branch to separatists in the embattled region of Kashmir. One of their demands, he says, was that ""Foreigners should not come to acquire control of the Indian economy."" Budget pressure may force India to follow through with privatization. The World Bank has cited concern that India's budget deficit is a whopping 9.6% of its gross domestic product, though much of the red ink can be traced to state budgets. Mr. Vyas of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy believes the real benefits of privatization will come only when the states start to sell off their bus companies and electric utilities -- but ""that's not even being talked about."" Media India has an unrestrained local press but remains suspicious of foreign media, especially when they show naked flesh or give their own spin on the Kashmir dispute. Technology has brought paradoxes: Indians now get scores of channels by cable TV, but only government-controlled TV over regular antenna. Foreign magazines and newspapers enter the country freely by the Internet but cannot print in India. (The Wall Street Journal is among the papers that have made informal efforts to lift the barrier.) The newly appointed information minister, Sushma Swaraj, a BJP hard-liner, this month seemed to be resolving the issues in favor of openness. At her prodding, the government suddenly allowed programmers to serve homes directly by satellite -- but with some tight restrictions on foreign ownership. Equally worrisome was Ms. Swaraj's explanation for the government's decision to move forward. Before, she explained, the government had no satellite facility in India; now it did, and could cut off broadcasts that offend India's programming code. Ms. Swaraj is looking for ways to regulate Web sites, too. ""They are bound by this code,"" she said. ""As yet there is no complaint. If there is, we can take care of it."" Ms. Swaraj started a ""national debate"" over whether to lift the restrictions on foreign media; 10 days later ended it with a firm 'no.' But as one door closes in India, another often cracks open. Private FM radio is expected to make its debut in the spring. The government has also taken steps to help film studios get expansion financing, just as Hollywood starts to prowl the Hindi film industry for investments. Telecommunications The Vajpayee government has earned broad kudos for its liberalization of telecommunications, and the results may even help build domestic support for other reforms. Sales of new telephones have exploded recently as service improves. In Bombay, which once had five-year waiting lists for new telephone lines, the government's local-phone company, MTNL, now promises, even if it doesn't always deliver, hookups in two days. The reason is new competition from a private group that includes a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp. Telecom investment is vital for India because so much of the country's booming software and call-center business relies on fast communications with the U.S. The government only recently loosened its control over international data gateways, a move that Indians hope will alleviate heavy daytime data traffic jams. Idika Solutions, a software company based in Hyderabad, got in the habit of downloading files at 6 a.m. to avoid the rush. Further reforms should speed up improvements. Next year, Parliament is expected to pass a ""convergence"" law, allowing telephone, wireless and data services to come under the same license. And the following year government phone company VSNL is scheduled to lose its monopoly on long-distance phone service. Trade In theory, India, a member of the World Trade Organization, has no choice but to open its borders to foreign products, and so far it is sticking to schedule, passing a new patents law and so forth. But rather than investing to get ready for free competition, many business families are simply getting out of manufacturing. Their worry isn't so much luxury goods from the West, which will still face steep duties even after quotas are lifted in the spring, but goods like batteries from China and palm oil from Malaysia. The government is starting to heed the call for more protection: Last week, it raised duties on cooking oil and listed 131 imported products that would have to list prices in rupees and register with the Indian bureaucracy. The government is also trying to prepare traditional businesses such as textiles for a world without quotas. Still, the industry is so thoroughly regulated that it is hard to see India's mild reforms having much effect. For example, the government just decided to allow big domestic producers to move into certain products that were reserved for small companies, but it still requires yarn-spinners to produce 10% of their yarn in a form that can be used by obsolete hand looms. With certain fabrics, ""if I produce it on a power loom, I'm breaking the law,"" says Ramesh Chander Kesar, president of the Textile Association India in New Delhi. ""Why should there should be a restriction?"" The main reason is that textiles employs an estimated one of every six Indian workers, and the government is loath to throw them out on the street. Actually, even when mills close, as many have in central Bombay, mill owners often have to keep paying the workers and are restricted in their reuse of the land. ""If we can fire a worker for not working, that will send a powerful signal. But there are no votes in it,"" says Gurchuran Das, former Procter & Gamble chief in India and occasional adviser to the Congress Party. ""Nobody has the courage to explain to the people the way Clinton had the courage to explain NAFTA: that jobs will be lost but, in the end, jobs will be created."" Some less courageous moves are possible: one idea under discussion in New Delhi is to give labor flexibility to companies that are exporting heavily. Finance India made some big financial reforms in the early '90s, with liberalization of interest rates, loosening of currency restrictions and encouragement of private banking. The country just needs some more money to prime the system. The government is approving new financial products, such as derivatives. The big prize, investment bankers say, would be opening of the government-controlled mutual fund and pension plans. Right now, they offer fixed returns. Private investment companies want the government to let them offer Indians more-aggressive private pensions. ""They are listening,"" says Raju Panjwani, managing director of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter India. ""Maybe equities are considered risky, but we can't even invest in corporate bonds."" The government has a plan under study, called ""Project Oasis,"" that would allow private pension fund management, with some restrictions. Another possible source of long-term capital is insurance, something there isn't much of in India. The government took a big step last year in allowing private insurance companies back into India after nearly 50 years. But as the race to start marketing policies begins, only half a dozen companies have jumped in. Foreign companies are limited to 26% of each insurance partnership. That is a problem, because launching an insurance company can take $75 million, and ""there are not that many Indian companies that can support 74% of that kind of a number,"" says Gary Benanav, chief executive of New York Life Insurance Co.'s international unit. The company, which is launching its India insurance venture in partnership with an Indian conglomerate, estimates the Indian market could support 50 insurance competitors. ""They've made a decision which I don't think in the long run is in the best interests of India, though I understand it. The colonial era has left a few wounds here,"" Mr. Benanav says.

Latest NFL Player News Brian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale. Coach Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23. Fantasy owners should look elsehwere for a Fantasy QB. Griese hasn't played in almost a month. A player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team. Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible. Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to Fantasy owners in deeper leagues. Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much as a result. James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three man. Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over the final two games. Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season. Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy value at this point in the season. Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs. Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in your Fantasy season. Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to play next Sunday against Cincinnati. James McKnight , WR DAL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea. R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder of the season. Larry Centers , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk. Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 12/11/00 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs. Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point. Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive. Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 346 yards. Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week. If you are one of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to Fantasy glory. Jeff George , QB WAS - Fear Updated 12/11/00 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this week's game against Dallas. The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins this week. Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns. He gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards. With his performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back. Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Top Dogs Updated 12/11/00 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday. Cris Carter , WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams. He will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter will be up for the task. He struggled in their first meeting but still managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown. Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' quarterbacks all together. Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy value to help you at this important stage of the season. Randy Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday. Look for Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week. He had six catches for 130 yards in their first meeting this season. Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham (groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' D this week. Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 Culpepper completed 21-of-33 passes for 221 yards and three touchdowns in a losing cause Sunday. He also added an eight-yard scoring run of his own. Although the Vikings struggled as a team Sunday Culpepper will continue to help Fantasy owners for the duration of the season. Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Coach Dick LeBeau was impressed enough with Mitchell's performance on Sunday against Tennessee that he named him the starting quarterback next Sunday against Jacksonville. The veteran QB was 12-for-26 passing for 131 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions, and was sacked four times. Mitchell should still be nowhere near your roster during the Fantasy playoffs. Brad Daluiso , K NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Daluiso ws good on all three of his field goal attempts on Sunday, converting from 38, 40 and 21 yards against Pittsburgh. He has now been successful on 12 consecutive attempts dating back to Week Seven against New York's next opponent, the Dallas Cowboys. Unless you have one of the league's top-notch kickers, starting Daluiso is a solid choice. Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 Ismail seemed to be much more in synch with quarterback Trent Dilfer during Sunday's game against San Diego. He had six catches for 80 yards and a touchdown, a 28-yarder the two call a ""slugo"" (slant and go). Although it looked for a bit like Ismail wasn't worth a look during your playoffs, he could finally be at the point where he'll give you good numbers. Give him consideration next Sunday when he faces Arizona. More Updates Copyright 2000 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc. Your site is always at FB10SP"

Baker III 4 Statement by Commissioner Bob Crawford, (D) 5 Gore Just Spinning About Supreme Court, Says Expert 1 REACTION TO GOVERNOR BUSH'S STATEMENT RE: What Gore needs to consider: ""The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like, and that Gore requested. Bush still won counting with Gore's rules... [Gore has] to consider where reasonable people in the center are going to look at this, and say, 'Guys you had your shot, the count, the recount - they changed the rules for you and you still did not win.' It's time to be magnanimous. RE: Governor Bush's Speech: ""...the tone...was perfect... ""There was a persistence and a determination in what [Governor Bush] said, but it was also incredibly conciliatory. It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has given in this, and that probably goes to peoples hearts."" - Bob Woodward on Larry King Live, CNN, 11/26/00 2 STATEMENT BY GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones. As our nation watched, we were all reminded on a daily basis of the importance of each and every vote. We were reminded of the strength of our democracy - that while our system is not always perfect, it is fundamentally strong and far better than any other alternative. The election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount and yet another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are honored and humbled to have won the state of Florida, which gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election. We will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to serve as America's next President and Vice President. Full statement: 3 STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III Ladies and Gentlemen, Shortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in this very room that the election process in - Florida and in the country as a whole - needed to conclude with fairness and finality. I suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about what was at stake. I warned that there might be no reasonable end to the process of counts, challenges and contests if it slipped away from us. So here is the account of the past 3 weeks. Full statement: 4 STATEMENT BY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER BOB CRAWFORD Democrat Member of Florida's Election Canvassing Commission Thank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job that you and your office have done during these last almost three weeks since the election. This has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty. But we got the job done, and we got it done right. People called me and say--particularly from out of state--and say what's going on down in Florida, and I have to keep reminding people, the only thing that's going on here is that we've got a razor-thin election for the most important job in the world. And that's all it is. After all the jokes, after all of the anguish, we've just got a close election. And any state that had to go through this would've had the same problems, I think, that we have had. But I think it's over. It should be over. And maybe that's the important word there, ""should."" You know, Yogi Berra once said, ""It's not over till it's over.'' Well, it's over, and we have a winner, and it's time to move on. There's one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have enough legal talent to keep this tied up through Christmas. But one thing the lawyers can't do for us and one thing the courts can't do for us: They can't bring this country together again. And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight, it's going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this country together again, and I hope we can get on with that work soon. And I'm proud of the job that we've done here in the state. 5 GORE JUST SPINNING ABOUT SUPREME COURT, SAYS EXPERT Fox News Channel, 11/26/00 FOX NEWS' BRIT HUME: ""...does the Gore team not have something to work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court coming up on Friday. That-that creates sort of a period of continuing, a sort of unfinality if such a word exists."" NATIONAL JOURNAL'S STUART TAYLOR: ""...Unless I'm missing something that is completely hollow spin. There is nothing what so ever, I think-that the Supreme Court of the United States can do for Al Gore. They could do some things for George W. Bush, but Al Gore hasn't asked them to do anything except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done. But I don't think he's in the position to say, ""Oh by the way could you order some more recounts?"" So I think there is nothing, if...Gore runs out of ammunition. Which I think he may well do, before the Supreme Court of the United States gets to a hearing. I think he has to give up, because there's nothing...""

Happy Holidays everyone, Subject: Bush's Testimony The founder of the (web?)site said he called Gore and Bush andasked them to send in their testimonies for the web site-since they BOTH ""claim"" to be Christians. Gore's office said that he didn't have one in typed form - but Bush did. Here it is...please pass this along! Very Important!!! This could change America. (Whether Democrat or Republican) If any of you are interested in what George Bush says about his faith, here it is. (Alex Mooney, State Senator) From George W. Bush: ""Actually, the seeds of my decision had been planted the year before, by the Reverend Billy Graham. He visited my family for a summer weekend in Maine. I saw him preach at the small summer church, St. Ann's by the Sea. We all had lunch on the patio overlooking theocean. One evening my dad asked Billy to answer questions from a big group of family gathered for the weekend. He sat by the fire and talked. And what he said sparked a change in my heart. I don't remember the exact words. It was more the power of his example. The Lord was so clearly reflected in his gentle and loving demeanor. The next day we walked and talked at Walker's Point, and I knew I was in the presence of a great man. He was like a magnet; I felt drawn to seeksomething different. He didn't lecture or admonish; he shared warmth and concern. Billy Graham didn't make you feel guilty; he made you feel loved. Over the course of that weekend, Reverend Graham planted a mustard seed in mysoul, a seed that grew over the next year. He led me to the path, and I began walking. It was the beginning of a change in my life. I had always been a ""religious"" person, had regularly attended church, even taught Sunday School. But that weekend my faith took on a new meaning. It was the beginning of a new walk where I would commit my heart to Jesus Christ. I was humbled to learn that God sent His Son to die for a sinner like me. I was comforted to know that through the Son, I could find God's amazing grace, a grace that crosses every border, every barrier and is open to everyone. Through the love of Christ's life, I could understand the life changing powers of faith. When I returned to Midland, I began reading the Bible regularly. Don Evans talked me into joining him and another friend, Don Jones, at a men's community Bible study. The group had first assembled the year before, in Spring of 1984, at the beginning of the downturn in the energy industry. Midland was hurting. A lot of people were looking for comfort and strength and direction. A couple of men started the Bible study as a support group, and it grew. By the time I began attending, in the fall of 1985, almost 120 men would gather. We met in small discussion groups of ten or twelve, then joined the larger group for full meetings. Don Jones picked me up every week for the meetings. I remember looking forward to them. My interest in reading the Bible grew stronger and stronger, and the words became clearer and more meaningful. We studied Acts, the story of the Apostles building the Christian Church, and next year, the Gospel of Luke. The preparation for each meeting took several hours, reading the Scripture passages and thinking through responses to discussion questions. I took it seriously, with my usual touch of humor....Laura and I were active members of the First Methodist Church of Midland, and we participated in many family programs,including James Dobson's Focus on the Family series on raising children. As I studied and learned, Scripture took on greater meaning, and gained confidence and understanding in my faith. I read the Bible regularly. Don Evans gave me the ""one-year"" Bible, a Bible divided into 365 daily readings, each one including a section from the New Testament, the Old Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs. I read through that Bible \ every other year. During the years in between, I pick different chapters to study at different times. I have also learned the power of prayer. I pray for guidance. I do not pray for earthly things, but for heavenly things,for wisdom and patience and understanding. My faith gives me focus and perspective.It teaches humility. But I also recognize that faith can be misinterpreted in the political process. Faith is an important part of my life. I believe it is important to live my faith, not flaunt it. America is a great country because of our religious freedoms. It is important for any leader to respect the faith of others. That point was driven home when Laura and I visited Israel in 1998. We had traveled to Rome to spend Thanksgiving with our daughter, who was attending a school program there, and spent three days in Israel on the way home. It was an incredible experience. I remember waking up at the Jerusalem Hilton and opening the curtains and seeing the Old City before us, the Jerusalem stone glowing gold. We visited the \ Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. And we went to the Sea of Galilee and stood atop the hill where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount. It was an overwhelming feeling to stand in the spot where the most famous speech in the history of the world was delivered, the spot where Jesus outlined the character and conduct of a believer and gave his disciples and the world the beatitudes, the golden rule, and the Lord's Prayer. Our delegation included four gentile governors, one Methodist, two Catholics, and a Mormon, and several Jewish-American friends. Someone suggested we read Scripture. I chose to read ""Amazing Grace,"" my favorite hymn. Later that night we all gathered at a restaurant in Tel Aviv for dinner before we boarded our middle-of-night flight back to America. We talked about the wonderful experiences and thanked the guides and government officials who had introduced us to their country. And toward the end of the meal, one of our friends rose to share a story, to tell us how he, a gentile, and his friend, a Jew, had (unbeknownst to the rest of us) walked down to the Sea of Galilee,joined hands underwater, and prayed together, on bended knee. Then out of his mouth came a hymn he had known as a child, a hymn he hadn't thought about in years. He got every word right: Now is the time approaching, by prophets long foretold, when all shall dwell together, One Shepherd and one fold. Now Jew and gentile, meeting, from many a distant shore, around an altar kneeling, one common Lord. Faith changes lives. I know, because faith has changed mine."" Icould not be governor if I did not believe in a divine plan that supersedes all human plans. Politics is a fickle business. Polls change. Today's friend is tomorrow's adversary. People lavish praise and attention. Many times it is genuine; sometimes it is not. Yet I build my life on a foundation that will not shift. My faith frees me. Frees me to put the problem of the moment in proper perspective. Frees me to make decisions that others might not like. Frees me to try to do the right thing, even though it may not poll well... The death penalty is a difficult issue for supporters as well as its opponents. I have a reverence for life; my faith teaches that life is a gift from our Creator. In a perfect world, life is given by God and only taken by God. I hope someday our society will respect life, the full spectrum of life, from the unborn to the elderly. I hope someday unborn children will be protected by law and welcomed in life. I support the death penalty because I believe, if administered swiftly and justly, capital punishment is a deterrent against future violence and will save other innocent lives. Some advocates of life will challenge why I oppose abortion yet support the death penalty. To me, it's the difference between innocence andguilt. Today, two weeks after Jeb's inauguration, in my church in downtown Austin, Pastor Mark Craig, was telling me that my re-election was the first Governor to win back-to-back, four-year terms in the history of theState of Texas. It was a beginning, not an end.... People are starved for faithfulness. He talked of the need for honesty in government. He warned that leaders who cheat on their wives will cheat their country, will cheat their colleagues, will cheat themselves. Pastor Craig said that America is starved for honest leaders. He told the story of Moses, asked by God to lead his people to a land of milk and honey. Moses had a lot of reasons to shirk the task. As the Pastor told it, Moses' basic reaction was, ""Sorry, God, I'm busy. I've got a family. I've got sheep to tend. I've got a life. ""Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt? The people won't believe me, he protested. I'm not a very good speaker. Oh, my Lord, send, I pray, some other person, ""Moses pleaded. But God did not, and Moses ultimately did His bidding, leading his people through forty years of wilderness and wandering, relying on God for strength and direction and inspiration. ""People are starved for leadership, ""Pastor Craig said, ""starved for leaders who have ethical and moral courage."" ""It is not enough to have an ethical compass to know right from wrong,"" he argued. ""America needs leaders who have the moral courage to do what is right for the right reason. It's not always easy or convenient for leaders to step forward,"" he acknowledged. ""Remember, even Moses had doubts."" ""He was talking to you,"" my mother later said. The pastor was, of course,talking to all of us, challenging each one of us to make the most of our lives, to assume the mantle of leadership and responsibility wherever we find it. He was calling on us to use whatever power we have, in business, in politics, in our communities, and in our families, to do good for the right reason. And his sermon spoke directly to my heart and my life.... There was no magic moment of decision. After talking with my family during the Christmas holidays, then hearing this rousing sermon, to make most of every moment, during my inaugural church service, I gradually felt more comfortable with the prospect of a presidential campaign. My family would love me, my faith would sustain me, no matter what. ""During the more than half century of my life, we have seen an unprecedented decay in our American culture, a decay that has eroded the foundations of our collective values and moral standards of conduct. Our sense of personal responsibility has declined dramatically, just as the role and responsibility of the federal government have increased. The changing culture blurred the sharp contrast between right and wrong and created a new standard of conduct: 'If it feels good,do it.' and 'If you've got a problem, blame somebody else'. ""Individuals are not responsible for their actions,"" the new culture has said. ""We are all victims of forces beyond our control."" We have gone from a culture of sacrifice and saving to a culture obsessed with grabbing all the gusto. We went from accepting responsibility to assigning blame. As government did more and more, individuals were required to do less and less. >The new culture said: if people were poor, the government should feed them. If someone had no house, the government should provide one. If criminals are not responsible for their acts, then the answers are not prisons, but social programs.... ""For our culture to change, it must change one heart, one soul, and one conscience at a time. Government can spend money, but it cannot put hope in our hearts or a sense of purpose in our lives.""... ""But government should welcome the active involvement of people who are following a religious imperative to love their neighbors through after school programs, child care, drug treatment, maternity group homes, and a range of other services. Supporting these men and women - the soldiers in the armies of compassion - is the next bold step of welfare reform, because I know that changing hearts will change our entire society."" ""During the opening months of my presidential campaign, I have traveled our country and my heart has been warmed. My experiences have reinvigorated my faith in the greatness of Americans. They have reminded me that societies are renewed from the bottom up, not the top down. Everywhere I go, I see people of love and faith, taking time to help a neighbor in need... These people and thousands like them are the heart and soul and greatness of America. And I want to do my part. I am running for President because I believe America must seize this moment, America must lead. We must give our prosperity a greater purpose, a purpose of peace and freedom and hope. We are a great nation of good and loving people. And together, we have a charge to keep."""

Bush 2 Statement by James Baker III re: FL Supreme Court Decision 3 Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again... 4 Washington Post: Send in the Thugs 5 Gore's Point Man Argued Against Dimples in 1996 1 Statement by Governor George W. Bush November 22, 2000 ""I am disappointed with last night's ruling by the Florida Supreme Court. We believe the justices have used the bench to change Florida's election laws and usurp the authority of Florida's election officials. We believe the court overreached. Writing laws is the duty of the legislature; administering laws is the duty of the executive branch. ""Two weeks after the presidential election, a court has decided that Florida's deadline for counting votes and certifying votes was not a deadline at all. The court has decided that the selective recounting of votes that have already been counted at least two times, and in some cases three or four times, will continue more than a week after the law says it should. And the court has ordered that the secretary of state must accept all this. ""The court had cloaked its ruling in legalistic language. But make no mistake, the court rewrote the law. It changed the rules, and it did so after the election was over. Full Statement: 2 Statement by James Baker III, Senior Advisor, Bush-Cheney Recount ""At Monday's oral argument before the Florida Supreme Court, Justice Harding asked a key question about Florida's electoral laws and standards: ""Is it right to change the rules in the middle of the game?"" ""The Florida Supreme Court and some Democratic county electoral boards have now decided to do just that. Full statement: 3 Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again To Count Dimpled Ballots, So... ~ For the past week, the Gore campaign has been saying that the Florida Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of this election. But now that they didn't get a decision exactly to their liking, the Gore campaign is backpedaling and saying that they will leave all their options open. ~ In response to inquiries about whether dimpled chads can be counted as votes, the Florida Supreme Court cited the Hartke case in Illinois, but the Illinois case didn't talk about dimpled chads at all. It involved hanging chads, the standard that these three counties began using and the standard that they are now seeking to change. ~ There has been a lot of talk about statutes in Texas governing manual recounts. In Texas this would all be over because Texas only allows one manual recount, and it has very clear and objective standards. The first of those is when you see light coming through, and the second of those is where you have a hanging chad. It's only in the third instance that the statute in Texas speaks about any consideration of a dimpled chad, and it doesn't say that a dimpled chad can be considered standing alone. It says it can be considered only where it also is accompanied by a clearly ascertainable intent of the voter to vote. ~ With its decision, the Florida Supreme Court has decided to 'change the rules in the middle of the game.' ~ The Florida Supreme Court has now assumed the role of both the executive and legislative branches. They effectively rewrote statutes that had been enacted by the Florida Legislature and took over responsibilities that rightly belonged to the Florida Secretary of State. ~ This decision by seven Democrat justices completely politicizes the vote-counting process by putting the fate of this election in the hands of the six Democrats, two independents and only one Republican that control the Canvassing Boards in the counties conducting manual recounts. ~ In a transparent attempt to overturn the results of this election, the Gore campaign is now trying to rewrite the rules in three counties that are still conducting manual recounts. ~ Statistical experts have said that under the current standards, Gore will not get enough votes to overcome Governor Bush's lead. So now the Gore campaign is looking to change those standards in the middle of the process. ~ The Gore campaign wants to count ballots that have only a slight indentation. No hole in the ballot is necessary. No single loose corner is necessary. Not even seeing any light through the ballot is necessary. This lenient standard has been proposed solely for Democrats to invent enough votes to overturn the election. ~ Ten years ago, the Democratic Supervisor of Elections in Palm Beach County issued a guideline about how ballots should be counted that stated, ""But a chad that is fully attached, bearing only an indentation, should not be counted as a vote."" Now Democrats want to unfairly change those rules. ~ The Gore campaign knows that the only way to get the votes they need is to keep changing the rules. This is unfair and unacceptable. This election must be decided by the rules that existed on Election Day, not the rules rewritten by the Gore campaign in a politically charged environment two weeks later. 4 The Washington Post SEND IN THE THUGS Michael Kelly 11/22/00 Excerpt: ""Even if Gore ultimately loses in Florida, he will have come very, very close to winning. Moreover, he will have done this with his image-skin more or less intact. For Gore has already won an astonishing propaganda victory: With the help of reasonably sympathetic coverage from a largely Democratic and liberal national press corps, he has managed to spin his extraordinary, radical, unprecedented behavior as reasonable - and legitimate. This probably ensures that future close presidential elections will produce future Gore Losers, marching off to the courts and the cameras with their armies of lawyers and thugs, demanding recounts, rewriting the rules and the laws, convincing more and more Americans that their electoral system is, like those in most of the world, just another rigged game. Thanks, Al, we needed that."" Full Story: 5 The Palm Beach Post Gore's Point Man Argued Against Dimples in 1996 Joel Engelhardt, Palm Beach Post 11/22/00 Excerpts: ""Amid the swarm of the world press outside the county Emergency Operations Center, Dennis Newman leads the charge to find new votes for Al Gore in the dimples of the Palm Beach County ballot. ""His argument, put simply, is that dimples show the true intent of the voter. Voters caused those dimples. Dimples should count. ""Four years ago, in a similar election spat, Newman took a much different stand. Employing his best legal tactics on behalf of a Democrat holding a slight lead in a primary race for Congress, Newman scoffed at the idea of counting the tiny indentations as votes. ""Like the Republicans watching now, Newman wondered out loud how ballots that had been handled over and over, in recount after recount, could still be impartially judged. Couldn't the ballots -- and therefore the votes -- be affected by all that touching and grabbing?

At this level we can then break things out into the required subfolders (e.g. accounting, trading, legal, ...). In this regard we have set up the I:/Newco/ directory and started to create subfolders. I ask everyone who has put information in the I:/trading/newco directory to move it to I:/Newco/ under their applicable subdirectory (which may need to be created). I apologize that this is a hassle for those who have already transfered files. If you have any concerns please let me know.

Normal,I hear your sister is looking for a piece of action so I thought you might tell her about the kid. Graduated in 1997 with an HBA from The Richard Ivey School of Business (University of Western Ontario) Started at Enron in may 97 as an analyst in the trading group working for Lavorato doing fundament analysis and acting as Lavo's trading assistant (slave) Started out trading BC Cash desk in June of 98. Moved over to trade short term Aeco in Sept 99. Did that for a year. Mike McDermott and Laird can let you know if I was any good. Went to Houston in Sept 2000 to trade east power. Traded Cinergy cash desk and worked next to Fletch Sturm (Cinergy Term Trader) for a year. Learned a little bit about trading from him. You know the rest. What are her measurements again. 26 36 26 Can that be right?

""Demand for all types of housing is set to surge ahead over the coming decade, leading to robust activity, rising prices and a stable investment climate,"" says the study, jointly written by ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, ReMax Western Canada and Clayton Research. And Calgary will have the hottest real estate market, with housing prices set to climb 20% to 25% in the next decade, the study says. Overall, the number of households will increase by 1.5 million over the next 10 years, leading to rising prices for existing homes and steady demand for newly built homes. Peter Norman, vice-president of Clayton Research, a Toronto-based real estate consulting firm, said the increase will be fuelled by three factors: younger Baby Boomers, between the ages of 35 to 45, who are looking to buy their first home or upgrade from their current residence; the children of the older Boomers, generally 45 to 55, who will be entering the real estate market for the first time; and immigrants. ""Housing prices will remain quite firm over the next 10 years and move up in real terms"" Mr. Norman said in an interview. The combination of high rents and low rental vacancies, particularly in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, will also help drive the housing market, as will the fact that there has been little or no construction of new rental units. And mortgage rates are so low that buying is often as financially palatable as renting, Mr. Norman added. The study concluded that the economy, although in a slump, is in much better shape than it was at the eve of the 1990s recession. Productivity and real income growth have recovered, unemployment is at lower levels than a decade ago, and the country's industrial structure has shifted away from a commodity and manufacturing base, the study said. ""A healthy, long-term economy will boost housing markets by keeping real incomes growing, real interest rates low, and providing confidence in the future performance of real estate assets."" Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, said Calgary would be the hottest market in the country thanks to increasing oilpatch activity, migration from other parts of the country and its youthful population. ""Calgary is going through its renaissance period,"" Ms. Alexander said, adding that its average home price of $180,000 is still 30% to 35% cheaper than Vancouver or Toronto. Toronto, with its average house price of $250,000, should see growth of 10% to 15%, Ms. Alexander said, because its population is heavily weighted toward 25 to 40 year olds -- who will buy their first home or upgrade -- and because of the scarcity of rental units. Meanwhile, Ottawa, despite the high-tech downturn, remained one of the hottest housing markets with prices up 10% from a year ago. That market is expected to grow as the federal government increases spending and creates new departments, older civil servants retire and new people are brought in, and the high-tech sector rebounds."

""Demand for all types of housing is set to surge ahead over the coming decade, leading to robust activity, rising prices and a stable investment climate,"" says the study, jointly written by ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, ReMax Western Canada and Clayton Research. And Calgary will have the hottest real estate market, with housing prices set to climb 20% to 25% in the next decade, the study says. Overall, the number of households will increase by 1.5 million over the next 10 years, leading to rising prices for existing homes and steady demand for newly built homes. Peter Norman, vice-president of Clayton Research, a Toronto-based real estate consulting firm, said the increase will be fuelled by three factors: younger Baby Boomers, between the ages of 35 to 45, who are looking to buy their first home or upgrade from their current residence; the children of the older Boomers, generally 45 to 55, who will be entering the real estate market for the first time; and immigrants. ""Housing prices will remain quite firm over the next 10 years and move up in real terms"" Mr. Norman said in an interview. The combination of high rents and low rental vacancies, particularly in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, will also help drive the housing market, as will the fact that there has been little or no construction of new rental units. And mortgage rates are so low that buying is often as financially palatable as renting, Mr. Norman added. The study concluded that the economy, although in a slump, is in much better shape than it was at the eve of the 1990s recession. Productivity and real income growth have recovered, unemployment is at lower levels than a decade ago, and the country's industrial structure has shifted away from a commodity and manufacturing base, the study said. ""A healthy, long-term economy will boost housing markets by keeping real incomes growing, real interest rates low, and providing confidence in the future performance of real estate assets."" Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, said Calgary would be the hottest market in the country thanks to increasing oilpatch activity, migration from other parts of the country and its youthful population. ""Calgary is going through its renaissance period,"" Ms. Alexander said, adding that its average home price of $180,000 is still 30% to 35% cheaper than Vancouver or Toronto. Toronto, with its average house price of $250,000, should see growth of 10% to 15%, Ms. Alexander said, because its population is heavily weighted toward 25 to 40 year olds -- who will buy their first home or upgrade -- and because of the scarcity of rental units. Meanwhile, Ottawa, despite the high-tech downturn, remained one of the hottest housing markets with prices up 10% from a year ago.

After deducting inflation, the average Toronto home should be worth anywhere from 15 per cent to 20 per cent more over the next decade, says a study released yesterday. Resale values for a Toronto home should do better than the national average, with a solid - although unspectacular - gain in equity, once inflation is factored in. That conclusion comes from research by real estate analysts Clayton Research Associates Ltd. in conjunction with ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada and ReMax of Western Canada. ""Toronto will remain the rock of Gibraltar, showing decent, steady gains over the next decade,"" says Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada. Given that capital gains on a principal home are not taxable, that means an average gain in equity to the Toronto homeowner of 1.5 to 2 per cent every year over the next decade. That might be nothing to do cartwheels over, but it's a relatively comfortable return considering the meltdown in the equity markets. Across Canada, the average home is expected to increase by about 13 per cent in 10 years. ""I've always said real estate is investment for dummies. You pay your mortgage, have someplace to live and you own a home in 25 years. It's not spectacular stuff, but you do come out ahead,"" says Alexander. That was not the case in the previous decade, however. From 1991 to 2001, home prices increased by only 9 per cent, from an average of $234,313 in 1991, to a forecasted $255,000 by the end of this year. If you factor in inflation, you'd be getting a negative return on your investment. However, Clayton Research says the next decade will be different than the last, primarily because: Demand for home ownership will remain elevated due to the low vacancy rates in Toronto rental accommodation. About half of Canada's international migration is destined for Toronto, which will boost population growth and first-time buyer demand. While the present economic slowdown is taking a toll on the Toronto economy, the medium-term outlook for Toronto is favourable. Canada-wide, the number of households is expected to expand by another 1.5 million over the next 10 years. While homes in Toronto, Ottawa and Kitchener-Waterloo are expected to post gains of 15 per cent to 20 per cent over the next decade, Calgary is forecast to lead the country in terms of appreciating housing values of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent. Clayton Research says the most significant event driving the housing market will continue to be demographic. The post-war generation born between 1946 and 1966 is moving into prime homeownership years. The youngest members of the group are 35 years old and will be 45 in 2011. According to census figures, people older than 45 are about 15 per cent more likely to own a home than people between 35 and 45. They are also set to inherit considerable wealth from their parents, a factor expected to affect their housing choices. On the other end of the market, the 20 to 35 age group is also expected to see a significant upswing, which means more people buying starter homes. Despite the lust we see for condominiums today, the study says that single detached homes will be the most popular dwelling of choice. ""The traditional single detached home will be in strongest demand over the coming decade"" representing 60 per cent of net new households. Condominiums and apartments will still see healthy demand."

The two investment banks are expected to make separate proposals as early as this week to a New York bankruptcy court, the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times reported yesterday, citing unidentified sources. Enron's trading business, which accounted for roughly 90 per cent of earnings in the third quarter, has deteriorated in recent weeks because of uncertainty about Enron's finances. JP Morgan Chase and Co., which like Citigroup is a large Enron creditor, is expected to submit its own offer at a later stage, the newspapers said. The potential size of the bids was not reported. Shares of Enron climbed 4 cents (U.S.) to close at 79 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. Negotiators for Enron, Citigroup and UBS met over the weekend to finalize the details of the proposals, although sources warned that either one may still be withdrawn, the newspapers said. According to the reports, Enron would retain a large minority stake under the terms of the proposals being prepared. Representatives from Citigroup and UBS said their companies would not comment on the matter. Enron did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Just months ago, Enron was the country's seventh-largest company in terms of revenue. But the company stock plummeted after the company in October revealed questionable partnerships that helped keep billions of dollars of debt off its books and Enron acknowledged it overstated profits for four years. The swift collapse has launched investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, labor department, justice department and a congressional committee. Yesterday, Enron said it will negotiate a retention plan for some of its remaining employees after paying $105 million during the past two months to keep almost 600 workers on the job. The former top energy trader paid $50 million in bonuses last month to keep 75 workers, mostly electricity and natural-gas traders, while trying to conclude a merger with rival Dynegy Inc. That's before paying $55 million in bonuses to about 500 employees just ahead of its Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing. Enron wants to retain employees needed to keep the trading business operating in hopes it can survive and emerge from Chapter 11 protection, analysts said. ""It seems logical that they would have to spend to keep key people,"" said Mike Heim, an A.G. Edwards analyst in St. Louis, Mo. Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer, however, said more job cuts are likely at the Houston-based company. He declined to comment on how much more Enron might spend on employee retentions. ""It depends on what we can work out with the creditors' committee,"" Palmer said. ""It's all up to the judge in the end, but usually the judge weighs heavily what the creditors' committee says."" Enron cut 60 per cent of the 7,500 workers at its Houston headquarters last week, and 1,100 jobs were eliminated in the U.K. Before the company filed for bankruptcy last week, it employed 21,000 people.
