*How to Get Easy to Understand PHP Performance Metrics to Quickly Improve
Your PHP Application Performance*

Sanju the summary is: Measuring the performance of an application is a
complex subject. You need to learn many aspects so you can determine how to
measure the performance values, so you can make good decisions on what you
can do to change your application code, to make your code run faster in a
way that is noticeable by the application users.

Visual tools can help you as an application developer to view and interpret
the current performance values, so you can compare those values before and
after you make code changes, so you can confirm that your application will
really run faster after you make those code changes.

Read this short article to learn more about how to visualize the
performance values of your Laravel or Symfony applications any time you
want using the Scout APM tool for free.

Competition Launch: RSNA Screening Mammography Breast Cancer Detection
Kaggle








Hi RnD Trichy,

As the world's most common cancer, 2.3 million women got diagnosed with  
breast cancer while 685,000 died in 2020 alone. Since early detection and  
treatment are critical to reducing cancer fatalities, your machine learning  
skills could help streamline the process radiologists use to evaluate  
screening mammograms.

In this competition, you'll train your model to identify breast cancer  
using screening mammograms obtained from regular screening.





Total Prizes:

$50,000


Entry Deadline:

February 20, 2023




Learn More




Your efforts in this competition could help extend the benefits of early  
detection to a broader population, further reducing breast cancer mortality  
worldwide.

Good luck,
