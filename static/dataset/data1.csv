Normal,"In regards to your E-mail, I have recently been informed by Nicole that she will be leaving Enron effective April 30. This is unfortunate because she has been a very valuable member of our team over the last few years and has been instrumental in developing the Eastern Rockies trading business and providing our customers with excellent service. Nicole is not leaving to go to a competitor, but is going to spend more time with her family. Given this fact, you probably want to speed up the transition. Call me and we can discuss.

The plan is for Susan to work with me in moving the day trading activities from the Denver office to Houston. Her specific goals will be to take over activities performed by Nicole and Theresa while generating EOL products with me and in my absence. Susan is currently learning how to use EOL and Sitara. She is also working on understanding the grid and the relationship between all the different trading points from Opal to the mid-continent. My plan is to have Susan go to the Denver office during May bid-week (April 22 - April 24). I want her to be sitting with Nicole and Theresa during bid-week to see and learn everything they do during that time. I will probably want Nicole and Theresa to come to Houston one more time to sit with us and the logistics team, maybe in early May. Then, Susan and I will both go to Denver in late May or early June to meet industry people and to complete the transfer of operations to the Houston office. We can finalize these plans early next week and make all the corresponding reservations. Thank you, Jay"

Normal,"George, I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. I still have the concerns that I had last week. Specifically that the costs of our project are too high. I have gathered more information that support my concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total $10.4 Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million. We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million. We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to discuss alternatives. Phillip"

I can't tell if he still owes $47 on his deposit. #13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140. #15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95. Hopefully, he won't have a bad reaction. #20b Missed rent? #26 Has she paid any deposit or rent? #27 Missed rent?"

Normal,Thanks for representing Matt. Phillip
Normal,"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 Phillip"
Normal,"Lucy, Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages. There are alot of overages. It will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather. You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap. This needs to be handwritten on all new leases. I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet. We also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap. I will write something today. Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start collecting. Phillip"

Normal,"Questions about 12/29 rentroll: There were two deposits that were not labeled. One for $150 and the other for $75. Which apartments? 20a or #13? Utility overages for #26 and #44? Where did you get these amounts? For what periods? What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. Is this right? Has the deposit been made yet?

Normal,"Gentlemen, I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure and a mortgage broker for help with the financing. Regarding the financing, I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston. I have sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information on you. Can you please send it to him. His contact information is: phone (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net. I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information. I hope to pull that together this afternoon. I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document. He was positive about his experience overall. He did not seem pleased with the bookkeeping or information flow to the investor. I think we should discuss these procedures in advance. Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur. Phillip"
Normal,"Jim, I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I described to you last week. The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos. There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved. As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee. If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required. I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing. I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks. I am faxing you a project summary. And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you. Let me know what else you need. The land is scheduled to close mid January. Phillip Allen"
Normal,"Jeff, Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th. I have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow. When will more money be required? Escrow for roads? Utility connections? Other rezoning costs? What about property taxes? The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I owned it. Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property? Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned? Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights? What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing? I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and American Multifamily walking on this deal. So I just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can. Phillip"

Normal,"Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. Specific questions should include: 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input. Phillip"

Is your understanding that the West desk will receive origination each month based on the schedule below. The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as follows: October 2000 $1,395,000 November 2000 $1,350,000 December 2000 $1,395,000 January 2001 $ 669,600 February 2001 $ 604,800 March 2001 $ 669,600 April 2001 $ 648,000 May 2001 $ 669,600 June 2001 $ 648,000 July 2001 $ 669,600 August 2001 $ 669,600 September 2001 $ 648,000 October 2001 $ 669,600 November 2001 $ 648,000 December 2001 $ 669,600 This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by the Denver desk. The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day (Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01). The ENA Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense. Let me know if you disagree. Phillip"

Normal,We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 to a 41.67 heat rate. We applied forward gas prices to historical loads. I guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year. Prices seem low. Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on Nov 99 loads and current gas prices. What about a forecast for this November loads. Let me know what you think. Phillip

Normal,"George, The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive. I have one other investor in addition to Keith that has interest. Some additional background information on Larry and yourself would be helpful. Background Questions: Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in Creekside. Please list projects completed during the last 5 years. Include the project description, investors, business entity, Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors. Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects. With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the investors. Preferable Investment Structure: Developers guarantee note, not investors. Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing. Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns. Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now. These questions are not intended to be offensive in any way. It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that leads to future opportunities. I am happy to provide you with any information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner. Sincerely, Phillip Allen"
Normal,"Bob, Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy Gay was on a personal leave. She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment to the west desk during that time. She frequently came to work before 4 AM to prepare operations reports. Patti worked 7 days a week during this time. If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti. She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time. Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. specialist. Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR. Let me know what is an acceptable cash amount. Phillip"

Normal,"Bob, Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award. Patti stepped up to fill the gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave. Patti held together the scheduling group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time. Patti was always the first one in the office during this time. Frequently, she would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package. All the traders came to depend on the information Patti provided. This information has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size of the west desk positions. Please call to discuss cash award. Phillip"

Normal,"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

Normal,"Gentlemen Good day. I hope all is going well. If I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. In addition, this includes the condition of what we can change for the two week period following acceptance (see below). This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable. Good news is that this deliverable and the Topic Framework deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project. Thanks Cheers Kirk ---------------------- Forwarded by Kirk McDaniel/HOU/EES on 10/23/2001 03:35 PM --------------------------- Kirk McDaniel 10/19/2001 08:27 AM To: Phillip K Allen/Enron@EnronXGate, Tim O'Rourke/Enron@EnronXGate, Yevgeny Frolov/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Ed McMichael/Enron@EnronXGate, Dutch Quigley/Enron@EnronXGate Subject: Revised High Level Design-Sign-off for Acceptance Phillip/Tim/Yevgeny Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable. Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase: ? Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role) ? Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report) ? Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before) Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

Enron stock is now lower than when I joined the company out of business school. I imagine there are quite a few not so happy people these days. We can relate somewhat over here at NPW with a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago). Knowing you, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you down much. I have taken a similar approach to our problems here at NPW. Hope everything else is going well for you and the family. Have you had the knee surgery yet? Give me a call when you have a chance.

Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI I am stuck on my last starter. Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season. Answer - GG Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is looking better each week. Answer - GG Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants' No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with Hilliard because of his experience and continuing improvement. Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson? Answer - GG Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with the hotter player, and that would be Thomas. Tip of the Week Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh. This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

Normal,"Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures. NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover. Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk. Turret Users An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"". Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors. While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels. The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment. Here's how: Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret. The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret. To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below: Channel Avaya Stentophon Weather Channel 12401 801 CNN Headlines News 12402 802 CNN Financial News 12403 803 CNBC 12404 804 MSNBC 12405 805 Bloomberg 12406 806 Financial News Network 12407 807 CNN 12408 808 Fox Sports 12409 809 ESPN1 12410 810 Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all. We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move. Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers. Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing. Updates will be provided as they become available. Keeping an Open forum We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to"

Normal,"[IMAGE] Fantasy Football Newsletter November 16, 2001 [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports [IMAGE]Fantasy Football [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter! The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru."" [IMAGE] Inside ? Plan for the Playoffs ? Game-by-Game Analysis ? Gridiron Guru ? Tip of the Week [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] Plan for the Playoffs The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.) If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season. If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup. Game-by-Game Analysis Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production. Gridiron Guru Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Question - Mike Blake I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten? Answer - GG Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad. Question - Russell Brown My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie. Answer - GG Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. Question - Chris Gilcrest Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, Curtis Martin? Answer - GG Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit is too good to ignore. Tip of the Week Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Normal,"GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th: The schedule is: Course # 7019-00: Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or Dec 31) This course is identical to the courses that started in October. It is being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school. Course details: - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron employees - Each course is limited to eight students - Meets once a week for eight weeks - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to include initial exam) - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline. - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees. Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees. Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance. HOW TO ENROLL: 1. Print out the attached registration form. 2. Complete the form, but please note the following SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS: A. Fill out the student information completely, including your email address. B. In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"", C. In the Payment section: For the course at Enron, the tuition is discounted by $200, to $899. FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is required on the registration form. Be sure to indicate complete cardholder information. 3. Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746. Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review. The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be honored. Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a waiting list for the course or courses indicated. Enrollments and waitlists will be confirmed by email. Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount. Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules. IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT: The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business school. Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants. While work experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially improve in a short period of time. THE TEXAS MBA TOUR: All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair. The participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M. The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call (800) 2REVIEW to register."
Normal,"Thanks. That is an interesting idea. I'd like to keep the rear stairway but that might still be possible. Anyway, let's see what happens with the variance. I appreciate your efforts. By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors? Bob ----- Original Message ----- From: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com> To: <wise.counsel@lpl.com> Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 8:19 AM Subject: RE: word file as promised Bob, I turned in the application for a variance yesterday. The hearing will be on January 8th. In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, the application had to be in by November 9th. I was under the impression that yesterday was the deadline. Sorry if I dropped the ball. On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful suggestions about the addition. It might be possible to move the addition forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space. You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new space for your game/play/music room. Then you could close off the existing play room to replace the bedroom lost. Part of the play room that is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for a built in desk with a couple of computers. This way you would not have to add a second staircase. The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction. In the back you could slope the roof until you were within the setback. Then you could place a large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up. >From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition. The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would be more shaded. That is the west side of the house so that might not be a bad thing. Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or dining room would still be possible. Personally, I think opening the dining room would be the better idea. I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exploring anything except your original plan. But I wanted to suggest something in case the variance was not granted. Let me know if you want me to try and sketch out these ideas. Phillip -----Original Message----- From: ""Robert W.

Normal,"I know that this is a difficult time for all of us. With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year. To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed. Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season. Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances. After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8. Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event. I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more. We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season. Ken Lay"

Sortable Standings ? Gridiron Guru ? Tip of the Week [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] Thanksgiving Football Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week. Sortable Standings Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them. Gridiron Guru Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Question - Marcus Howell Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego? Answer - GG Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has never been able to string many good performances together in the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post respectable numbers at Dallas. Question - Eric Fernau Which three running backs should I start? I have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest Holmes and Garrison Hearst. Answer - GG Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. Staley should have little trouble ripping through the Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game. Question - Jay Rassat Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle). Answer - GG Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New England QB. Tip of the Week Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a back like Alexander.

Normal,"As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history. We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition. It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs. ? ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program. The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders. Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored. Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service. Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ? Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely. As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations. Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored. We regret that we have had to make these changes. We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period."

Normal,"Good morning, In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings. I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them. This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. Thanks, Kam x3-5781"

Normal,"Pam, Can you help with below? David -----Original Message----- From: Allen, Phillip K. Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 11:18 AM To: Oxley, David Subject: RE: Answer David, For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3. Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan. The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"". This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution. I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount. I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L. In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1. This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares. Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value. This is the methodology described in Section 7.1. Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns. Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further. Phillip -----Original Message----- From: Oxley, David Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 8:31 AM To: Allen, Phillip K. Cc: Whalley, Greg; Joyce, Mary Subject: Answer For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA, a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."

Normal,"Phillip, It will go along this lines: (Conservative) We pay ""0"" going forward We have already played 300K in 3Q2001 Outstanding bill for $27,740 will hit Enron Q1, 2002 Enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally We value Enrons SME time @ around 300K Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use. This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture Enron would receive 0% royalty on all external sales. I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. Also, I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved. If we do not reach the agreement: 1. Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate) The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or 2. Continue ""as is"" with payment differed for 90 days or merger.

In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost. (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K) The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one. Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting. Also, I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions. I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time. We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses. One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow. Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization? Please consider the costs of finishing this project.

Normal,"Phillip, Here are the key points that came out of today's meeting: 1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type. 2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next week to gather content and a second meeting for review. 3. We will change ""Gas Daily Risk"" to ""Intra-Month Risk"" throughout the simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk? 4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?

Normal,"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking (IBS) Clients: You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line. We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away. To our IBS Billpayer clients: During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support). Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information: 1) You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #. 2) You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as: Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before). Always remember that your password is case sensitive. Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future. Sincerely, Howard Gordon Network Manager - geninfo.vcf"

Normal,"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA, a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."

Normal,"Wow! this looks complicated. let me get some help on this and get back to= you -----Original Message----- From: =09Allen, Phillip K. =20 Sent:=09Friday, November 16, 2001 8:38 AM To:=09Whalley, Greg; Lavorato, John Subject:=09FW:=20 Greg, After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de= ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg= arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20 Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis= tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe= nalty. This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision = of the plan. It also states that the account balance shall be determined a= s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re= ceives the written request of the participant. In my case this would be as= of September 30th. I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%= of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001. The plan administ= rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently. Their reading yield= s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St= ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of Enron Corp. sha= res in the account as of September 30, 2001. Their justification is that i= n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th= at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o= f Enron Corp. common stock. There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation. First,= section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.= "" This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se= ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no= t apply. Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib= ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay= ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution. The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3. If that = is the case then section 7.1 should apply. This section does provide for t= he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares. However, it states ""The val= ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin= g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay= ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".= This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every= share in the account on January 1, 2001. Although this would be the most = beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor= p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share, this methodology goes beyond se= ction 6.3. The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of= distribution under each of the three interpretations: Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1 Number of shar= es Relative share Phantom Stock 10% -600=09=09=09=09-54,866 Value to be shares=09=09=09$493,792 Current stock shares=09=09=0949,379 shares I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair. If the = administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7= .1 should apply. The current interpretation of the plan administrators is = a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. = =20 In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the= same issue. I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt= er. Sincerely, Phillip Allen =20"

Normal,"Mac, Thanks for the research report on EOG. Here are my observations: Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices: (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. I think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. Current price 37 Nat. Gas 34 Crude 10 Total 81 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?

Then copy this formula to the rows below. 2. Column H needs a formula. Subtract amount paid from amount owed. =e6-g6. 3. Column F is filled with the #### sign. this is because the column width is too narrow. Use you mouse to click on the line beside the letter F. Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider. 4. After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

Normal,"Mark, Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal basis and socal/san juan spreads. I listed the days during bidweek that reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints before and after bidweek. The following observations can be made: July 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs actual of .79 2. Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91 3. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium. Aug. 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs actual of .99 2. Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49 3. Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the monthly postings 4. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

Normal,"Folks, I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement - that I think will be interesting to the group. I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00 - a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete. I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash - structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks. Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book. <A Concrete Research by David Moore</A> Regards, Harry Francis"

According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal. At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell $172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00. ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower."" Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees, and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend. Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday. ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader. At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased $206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday. PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled to restart this weekend. At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at $325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday. -Robert Scalabrino PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and falling natural gas prices, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $62.00-$76.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday. ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration the market had pretty much dried up."" Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main reason for the decline in spot market prices. Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of $2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts indicated reduced utility load requirements. In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets. Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13 higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the $67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00- $92.00. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19 to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the market opened down to $59.00 after options expired. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17 lower at $65.00-$100.00. Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively. Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired generation to meet increased weather-related demand. Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu. ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much more realistic prices."" Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00 yesterday. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00. ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said. ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices, causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was forecast for the region this week, traders said. Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week. ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the north."" Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour. ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices, declined to $60 and less."" The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95 to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent estimates. Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week caused prices to decline in the region. In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was the main culprit behind lower prices. ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill. Yesterday, it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold."" Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday. -Brian Whary U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to increase household consumption for space heating, traders said. The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01 pounds a megawatt-hour. Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15 pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday. December continued to fall amid a combination of position closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said. December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade. First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue to stifle demand, traders said. January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence. First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close. Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer 2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour. Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a megawatt-hour. Open positions on many short-term structures will likely force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run- up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more easily be assessed. -Nick Livingstone Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said. Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt- hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076 megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446 megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing. Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating. Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders said. ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price."" Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict temperatures to begin falling. Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22 percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell 4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts. Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week. Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter- term contracts. Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour, 1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers to meet the increased demand, other traders said. Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor, will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said. Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said. -Nick Livingstone -0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf"

Normal,"Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. Specific questions should include: 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input. Phillip"
Normal,"Jeff, Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th. I have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow. When will more money be required? Escrow for roads? Utility connections? Other rezoning costs? What about property taxes? The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I owned it. Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property? Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned? Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights? What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing? I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and American Multifamily walking on this deal. So I just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can. Phillip"

Normal,"Jim, I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I described to you last week. The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos. There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved. As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee. If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required. I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing. I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks. I am faxing you a project summary. And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you. Let me know what else you need. The land is scheduled to close mid January. Phillip Allen"

Normal,"Questions about 12/29 rentroll: There were two deposits that were not labeled. One for $150 and the other for $75. Which apartments? 20a or #13? Utility overages for #26 and #44? Where did you get these amounts? For what periods? What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. Is this right? Has the deposit been made yet? A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly. Phillip"

Normal,"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""I was getting worried,"" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

Normal,"George, The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for. I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. Call or email to let me know if this would work for you. pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work) Phillip Allen PS.

Normal,"Lucy, Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column. The other questions I had about last week's rent are: #15 Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26. What is going on? #25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend. Phillip"

Normal,"Jeff, I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. There are several reasons that I won't commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. Can you clarify the dates in the contract. Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer. If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list. Email or call me later today. Phillip"
Normal,"Jeff, My target is to get $225 back out of the stage. Therefore, I could take a sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K. This would still only require $75K cash from the buyer. After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around $20K cash. You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email. Do you want to give the New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal. Phillip"

Normal,"Jacques, Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? The key business points are: 1. Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours. We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted.

I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. The missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 2. #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 3. #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 4. #11 Missed on 2/2? 5. #13 Missed on 1/26? 6. #14 missed on 2/2? 7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19? 8. #20a missed on 2/2? 9. #35 missed on 2/2? My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on some of these. I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit. Will have some time today to work on a utility letter. Tried to call Wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.

Normal,"John, Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts? I will set up a room with Kim. Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen: 1. Review and document systems and processes - The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements. I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing scheduling in Unify are grey. 2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts. Are we looking at everything we should? Putting a person with a trading mentality should add some value and direction to the group. In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD to work part time to get it done. Phillip"

It is not on any rentroll that I can see. #9 Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she will start paying on #9 #15 Since he has been such a good tenant for so long. Stop trying to collect the $95 in question. #33 Missed rent. Are they still there? #26 I see that she paid a deposit. But the file says she moved in on 1/30. Has she ever paid rent? I can't find any on the last three deposits. #44 Have the paid for February? There is no payment since the beginning of the year. #33 You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit? The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent. I need you to figure these out immediately. I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll in case you need to research these questions. I will not be in the office next week.

I have gathered more information that support my concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total $10.4 Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million. We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.

Phillip Allen Keith Holst ENRON 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX? 77002-7361 Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout Dear Phillip and Keith: We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ? Sincerely, [IMAGE] ? ? ? George W. Richards President P.S.?????

Normal,Here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format. The summary presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions.
Normal,"Gentlemen, Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date. I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed. We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugo's number is 512-295-8052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used. Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday. We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project. Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward. Phillip"

Normal,"Jacques, I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time. It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal). One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied. I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price. Can you help clear this up. Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released. Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities. On the other hand, conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was clean. What is your inclination? Call as soon as you have a chance to review. Phillip"

Specific features include: Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs Wood stairs Two story porches on front and rear Granite counters in kitchens and baths Tile floors in upstairs baths Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers) Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths Solid wood interior doors Windows fully trimmed Crown molding in downstairs living areas 2x6 wall on west side Undecided items include: Vinyl or Aluminum windows Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim or rough white brick on 3-4 sides I have faxed you the floor plans. The dimensions may be to small to read. The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'. For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, but only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage. Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design? It is basically a box with a simple roof line. Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

Normal,"Greg, Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates: Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable) What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent? Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit. Why is profit only 4%? Why are the architect fees up to $200K. I thought they would be $80K. What is the $617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high? Who receives the 2 points? How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us? Where is your 1%? Are you receiving one of the points on the loan? What is the status on the operating pro forma? My back of the envelope puts NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses. After debt service that would only leave $122K. The coverage would only be 1.16. Talk to you this afternoon. Phillip"

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management. In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That risk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity. As to the asset management: do you have any preference on structure? Are there elements that you would like to see? Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Laird"
Normal,"Reagan, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. Below is a list of questions on the specs: 1. Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine? Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5. Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial one out of iron. Only about 5 feet. 9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 A/C units? I am assuming 2. 12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron railings? 15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except for change orders? I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up. I am going to call Cary Kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas. Phillip I"
Normal,"Cary, Here is the picture of the house I have in mind. I was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley. A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive. I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. Also the front porch would be smaller. I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.

Normal,"Reagan, I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas? I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. I am not discounting those services. I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week. Phillip"

I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you. In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.

Normal,"Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline. I am expecting to pay something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range. I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done. It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding. If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify. Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release. If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities. Hopefully things will go smoothly. Phillip"

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt- hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range. ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader. According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight. At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank $202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range. Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage that began March 31. At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00. According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling demand 84 percent below normal. ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader. At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at $175.00-$228.00. According the California Independent System Operator today's forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743 megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. -Robert Scalabrino Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in available generation coupled with less weather-related demand, caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said. According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri, temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively. In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from Friday. ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week long."" Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000 megawatts through Friday. Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to hit the grid tomorrow. Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 nuclear power facilities. The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1 at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned and operated by Niagara Mohawk. Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to $58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to $51.25 and $40.00 indices. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast, traders said. ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said. ""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of that."" The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25 when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired. Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00 and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the Southeast was expected to remain high into next week. Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at $28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee, forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday. ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an ECAR trader said. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up, though traders said transmission problems limited volume. Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50, and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with trades from $32.00-$40.00. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs. For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern half of the region at $45.00-$52.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska. ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said. ""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said. Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is expected to begin Wednesday. Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity, temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week, propelling air conditioning demand, traders said. The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20. Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50. On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range. In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000. ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader. ""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree (Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is 85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us."" On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at $35-$36. Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC. Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range. In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders said. On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades were noted. -Brian Whary U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K. fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling interest, traders said. Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than Friday. The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting price levels, traders said. Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said. June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour. On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15 pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since the start of last week. Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements. Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels, they said. -Amal Halawi Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid limited hydro-supply, traders said. Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00 megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50- 214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour. ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo- based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are steadily climbing.'' Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters. Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet outlooks.'' Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour, down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year. Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour with 140 megawatts exchanged. Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours. -Alejandro Barbajosa -0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf"

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees between operating companies and new ventures.

Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education need to be completed via the HR Global Information System. HRGIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet. Just go to hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link. Or just type eglobal.enron.com on the command line of your browser. The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.

Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7) To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii) Budget (due Jan 3, 2002) To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii) Seating Plans Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv) Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis. Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are. I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this. I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

Normal,"Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90 per sq. ft. excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:19 AM To: Morgan, Richard Subject: Richard, I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's. I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. I already have my blueprints completed. What I took from our conversation was to use the SIP's with 8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. I was wondering about alternatives. Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. But would the foam insulation be as effective? Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money. I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference. Thank you for your help.

Normal,"Phillip, This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event. The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent. As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent. We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares). If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares. Please let me know you preference. As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt. As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files. He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself) and the various plan provision amendments. If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology. Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly (we will not release any information about these accounts until we verify that all information is correct and accurate). We are finalizing these accounts today and should have them available for access this afternoon (late) or this evening. Once we release these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as: Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before).

Just wanted to let you know that I will be taking over the role of producint the expert stories for our simulation. I understand you will be obtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories. Thank you for your help. Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind: Number of SMEs needed: 10 Number of expert stories: 20-25 Characteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a mix of structurers, originators and traders I've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will follow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories. The main difference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of 11/30. By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with them for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at least 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday. (11/26-11/28) --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs (11/28-11/30) --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding the simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to discuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot. (12/3-12/6) --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we need and where they can provide stories. --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the stories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video shoot. --Make changes to stories, if necessary. --Send final stories and video shoot logistics to SMEs (12/10-12/12) --Video shoot Please let me know if you have any questions.

Normal,"Michelle Here are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature). Sheri When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?

There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been discussing. These changes result in: Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below) No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and talent) that we have casted for. Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts. We have recieved today (mid-day). Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th. This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our scripts. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Normal,"Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out. I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached. In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you.

Normal,"Wow! this looks complicated. let me get some help on this and get back to= you -----Original Message----- From: =09Allen, Phillip K. =20 Sent:=09Friday, November 16, 2001 8:38 AM To:=09Whalley, Greg; Lavorato, John Subject:=09FW:=20 Greg, After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de= ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg= arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20 Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis= tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe= nalty. This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision = of the plan. It also states that the account balance shall be determined a= s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re= ceives the written request of the participant. In my case this would be as= of September 30th. I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%= of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001. The plan administ= rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently. Their reading yield= s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St= ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of Enron Corp. sha= res in the account as of September 30, 2001. Their justification is that i= n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th= at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o= f Enron Corp. common stock. There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation. First,= section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.= "" This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se= ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no= t apply. Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib= ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay= ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution. The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3. If that = is the case then section 7.1 should apply. This section does provide for t= he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares. However, it states ""The val= ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin= g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay= ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".= This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every= share in the account on January 1, 2001. Although this would be the most = beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor= p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share, this methodology goes beyond se= ction 6.3. The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of= distribution under each of the three interpretations: Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1 Number of shar= es Relative share Phantom Stock 10% -600=09=09=09=09-54,866 Value to be shares=09=09=09$493,792 Current stock shares=09=09=0949,379 shares I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair. If the = administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7= .1 should apply. The current interpretation of the plan administrators is = a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. = =20 In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the= same issue. I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt= er. Sincerely, Phillip Allen =20"

Normal,"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA, a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."

Normal,"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking (IBS) Clients: You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line. We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away. To our IBS Billpayer clients: During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support). Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information: 1) You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #. 2) You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as: Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before). Always remember that your password is case sensitive. Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.

According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal. At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell $172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00. ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower."" Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees, and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend. Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday. ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader. At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased $206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday. PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled to restart this weekend. At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at $325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday. -Robert Scalabrino PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and falling natural gas prices, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $62.00-$76.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday. ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration the market had pretty much dried up."" Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main reason for the decline in spot market prices. Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of $2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts indicated reduced utility load requirements. In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets. Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13 higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the $67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00- $92.00. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19 to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the market opened down to $59.00 after options expired. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17 lower at $65.00-$100.00. Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively. Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired generation to meet increased weather-related demand. Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu. ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much more realistic prices."" Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00 yesterday. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00. ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said. ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices, causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was forecast for the region this week, traders said. Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week. ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the north."" Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour. ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices, declined to $60 and less."" The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95 to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent estimates. Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week caused prices to decline in the region. In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was the main culprit behind lower prices. ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill. Yesterday, it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold."" Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday. -Brian Whary U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to increase household consumption for space heating, traders said. The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01 pounds a megawatt-hour. Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15 pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday. December continued to fall amid a combination of position closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said. December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade. First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue to stifle demand, traders said. January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence. First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close. Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer 2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour. Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a megawatt-hour. Open positions on many short-term structures will likely force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run- up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more easily be assessed. -Nick Livingstone Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said. Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt- hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076 megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446 megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing. Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating. Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders said. ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price."" Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict temperatures to begin falling. Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22 percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell 4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts. Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week. Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter- term contracts. Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour, 1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers to meet the increased demand, other traders said. Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor, will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said. Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said. -Nick Livingstone -0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf"

I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet. As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our comments today along with a cover letter. We have to fully understand the charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today.

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt- hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range. ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader. According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight. At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank $202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range. Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage that began March 31. At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00. According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling demand 84 percent below normal. ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader. At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at $175.00-$228.00. According the California Independent System Operator today's forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743 megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. -Robert Scalabrino Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in available generation coupled with less weather-related demand, caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said. According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri, temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively. In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from Friday. ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week long."" Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000 megawatts through Friday. Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to hit the grid tomorrow. Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 nuclear power facilities. The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1 at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned and operated by Niagara Mohawk. Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to $58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to $51.25 and $40.00 indices. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast, traders said. ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said. ""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of that."" The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25 when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired. Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00 and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the Southeast was expected to remain high into next week. Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at $28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee, forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday. ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an ECAR trader said. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up, though traders said transmission problems limited volume. Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50, and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with trades from $32.00-$40.00. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs. For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern half of the region at $45.00-$52.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska. ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said. ""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said. Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is expected to begin Wednesday. Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity, temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week, propelling air conditioning demand, traders said. The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20. Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50. On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range. In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000. ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader. ""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree (Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is 85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us."" On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at $35-$36. Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC. Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range. In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders said. On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades were noted. -Brian Whary U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K. fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling interest, traders said. Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than Friday. The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting price levels, traders said. Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said. June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour. On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15 pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since the start of last week. Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements. Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels, they said. -Amal Halawi Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid limited hydro-supply, traders said. Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00 megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50- 214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour. ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo- based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are steadily climbing.'' Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters. Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet outlooks.'' Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour, down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year. Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour with 140 megawatts exchanged. Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours. -Alejandro Barbajosa -0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf"

Normal,"Jeff, I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter. Regarding the utilities, you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now. I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release. I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday. The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week. Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs. Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected. The utilities are already in her name. In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip. Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release. Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes. I expect to have that done by Friday. I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday. As far as the utilities go, I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand. I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.

Normal,"Carlos, Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions? I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly. Here is my situation. I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago. I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th. I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000. See calculations below: Sales price: 2,100,000 Purchase price 1,200,000 Fees&Devel costs 500,000 Profit 400,000 The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan. I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange. I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify. First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago. I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project. We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me. The loan still exist. I am an 80% limited partner. Another investor is the other limited partner. We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner. We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange? Second, I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000. I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing. I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP. If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property. My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name. Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity? Thank you in advance for your help.

Normal,"John, Two items: 1. I spoke to John McKay about Sumas. His views seem well thought out. He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st. See attached spreadsheet. In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10. But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85. Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40 His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet. Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't support that premium. In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book. 2. I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues."

Normal,"jeff, Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE or just above market. If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply? If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time. Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis. In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron. The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg). When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers). In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market. The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03. The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious). Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts. The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts. Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost. Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access. Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions. (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.) In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts. All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights. We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive. We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT. Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you. Thanks, Jeff"

Normal,"Greg, I noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway. = First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected. Second, p= art of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for ""seniors"". I would l= ike to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assist= ed living). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below. As I hav= e mentioned, my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over th= e next two years. At the current rate that amount would cover the equity r= equirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest p= artner like Keith. Here is the article: Sector 2 plan geets boost from council By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter H= ome and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised futu= re land use plan to consult for development in the area. The San Marcos Ci= ty Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two = Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 squa= re mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable a= nd appropriate for the region. Significant to the revisions are those affe= cting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corne= r of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street). We= atherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of vari= ous city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner say= s were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two = plan. Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no dir= ect effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density resid= ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of= commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven a= dditional acres of low density residential. In addition, the total eight a= cres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is su= ggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing= development in the revised future land use plan. The total 10 acres of co= mmercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to ""community commerci= al"" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ens= ure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete wit= h buffering and landscaping. A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed t= o separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan. = However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew som= e concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may po= se on the busy state highway. Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing th= e proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Ave= nue. While the state highway department and city would have input into the= plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron= Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between= the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford. Council member Jane Hughso= n supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sect= or Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in th= e area as development proceeds. ""I'd rather say ""no' and if someone comes = us with a really good idea, look at it then,"" Hughson said. Councilman Ed = Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of th= e curb cut. ""It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happe= n there,"" Mihalkanin said. A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclud= e curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San = Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting = against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the= meeting. Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from severa= l residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good = compromise. Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active crit= ic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concernin= g the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests = of the city as a whole.

The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions. The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations. The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists. ``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company. Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687. El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy until September 30, 2001. Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration. Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request bids for each of the gas packages. The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784. << File: OEI.xls >>"

Normal,"Michael, I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options. Unfortunately, they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future. The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place. They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options. It was worth a try. Phillip"

Yes, it's true, suggest SG Cowen media analysts Ed Hatch, Peter Mirsky and Eric Handler, in this week's Media Money Manager. Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies ""to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports."" Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp.

It could start with sighs and rolling eyes then build to comical efforts to be put out of their misery. (gun to head or rope around neck) 2.

Normal,"David, For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3. Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan. The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"". This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution. I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount. I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L. In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1. This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares. Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value. This is the methodology described in Section 7.1. Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns. Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further. Phillip -----Original Message----- From: Oxley, David Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 8:31 AM To: Allen, Phillip K. Cc: Whalley, Greg; Joyce, Mary Subject: Answer For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA, a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."

Normal,"Greg, This spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San Marcos by unit. Next, I want to look at the numbers by bedroom. Let's compare numbers. Here is a list of questions: 1. Unit mixes of all proposed projects. 2. Completion date of Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr. (186) 3. Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds? This spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005. San Marcos will have over 6,000 units. If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%. That would not be a disaster. Tomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data. Let me know what you think. Phillip"

The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply. We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.

Normal,"John, The spreadsheet below (""Valuation Summary.."") calculates the value Enron would realize if we turned back the capacity or released it at full tolls. As of 9/17 mids, the 200,000/d leg would generate $16,918,907 if turned back. There is still a substantial amount of value above variable costs on the books.

I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged. Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.

Subject:=09Bishops Phillip, I am trying to press Bank to get the Deed of Trust to you. I am in a balanc= ing act between moving on the construction and holding until the lien is pe= rfected. I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to= get it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means i= t will be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for s= ignature and recording. Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to ma= ke sure you know when, where, and how as soon as I know. I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal an= d gave the information to us over the phone. The appraised value as built = is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695. The problem is the Land Value is $= 1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Ja= nuary. Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top= of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to s= how an increase in value?. I am tending to think we are going to reduce ou= r overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost = and some other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall de= bt and resultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a= greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be o= ut of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk be= ing short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have be= en working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effec= ts each change will have on your equity and return. We are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have= had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the = overall construction budget. The biggest is the detention pond dredging wh= ich has gone up in cost. The only area left to work through is the foundat= ion/concrete number and I am confident we will hit that one on the mark.

Normal,"Richard, I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's. I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. I already have my blueprints completed. What I took from our conversation was to use the SIP's with 8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. I was wondering about alternatives. Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. But would the foam insulation be as effective? Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money. I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference. Thank you for your help. Phillip Allen pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041"

We pretty much make whatever you would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are durable and solidly constructed. We build them in our shop and the ownner is rersponsible for their delivery. There is no labor cost so you are only charged for the materials. Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening. I would think that would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually varies between $800 and $900. Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive. It has vinyl siding and aluminum soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe Pronschinske. This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize and legally you are to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it. Your dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though. The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door. We are presently building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up door. The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be roughly $1500. We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your needs. With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to finish that one on time.

Hi Kirk, Here are the answers to some of your questions and concerns on the Topic Frameworks. These updates, along with discussions with SMEs, took a total of one hour. Accounting and Reporting - (1) Deal Flow - <<According to Berney Aucoin>> there is no difference between an Orginator/Marketer on the deal flow, they stated that a deal is a deal and it is the same for everyone. (2) Roles associated within the Desk - <<According to Berney Aucoin >> Admin support and Commerical support should not be added. We are concentrating on the major roles within a desk, any more granular could be inaccurate because it is different for every company. Admin support - answers the phones and Commerical support runs the books in the back office. Commodity Fundamentals - (1) Broker fees and Margin calls were added in the overview, <<According to Berney Aucoin>> it was worth mentioning, but wholesale is exempt from fees and taxes. (2) Industrial, Retail and Wholesale was added as an i.e., by consumption by consumer Organizational Structure - (1) Communication - Inter/Intra department communications were added into the Challenges of Managing Trading Function and Trading System. Inter department communication (i.e., between departments within organization) and Intra department communications (i.e., between roles on a desk after a trade/deal) (between desks, internal communication between Marketer, Originator, Structurer and Trader, after a trade and reconciling position reports) Risk Management Inputs - Consequences within VaR guidelines was added to ""Trading outside of prescribed VaR guidelines Swaps - Types of credit classifications was added to Credit Review under Protecting Againist Loss.

Normal,"Greg, I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format. The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000. But there is not a professional management company. Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000. However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit. This would yield an NOI of $240,000. Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside. The asking price is $2,700,000. Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap. Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap. The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project. The cost per square foot is 36.58. The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million. Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go. This property has not been on the market. So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it. If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million. It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants. Plus the location is by far the most convenient. Financing is the other consideration. I am assuming 25 year, 7%, and 25% down. What do you think could actually be achieved? Can you put me in contact with a lender? I will follow up with a phone call. Thanks, Phillip"
Normal,"Jeff, I reviewed your revised offer sheet. I am OK with the effective income of $484K. Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number. The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on. $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI. I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon. He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization. See the attached spreadsheets."
Normal,Here is lakeside in your format. Looks like 11% cash on cash plus whatever principal is paid on the note. My biggest concern is that actual vacancies and concessions have been higher than in the pro forma used to underwrite the offering. Also expenses were higher. Why would we be able to do any better than the existing management? I would like to come see it again on Wednesday. I would be bringing 1 or 2 others. Could we see it in the morning around 9:30 or 10 am? Phillip

Normal,"Richard, I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included. So that reduces some of the savings. Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home. Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate. Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs. I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do. What are some other alternatives that would also be effective? Radiant barrier? More attic ventilation? Thank you for your help.

Subject: RE: Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90 per sq. ft. excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:19 AM To: Morgan, Richard Subject: Richard, I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's. I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials. I already have my blueprints completed. What I took from our conversation was to use the SIP's with 8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep. The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget. I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house. I was wondering about alternatives. Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec. He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels. But would the foam insulation be as effective? Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money. I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference. Thank you for your help.

Phillip -----Original Message----- From: Sent: Monday, November 05, 2001 5:11 PM To: pallen@enron.com Cc: kmcdani@enron.com Subject: Interface Design Update Phillip, The purpose of this e-mail is to explain the results of our discussions with the technical team after our meeting with you. We need to get your approval of the points listed below so that we can begin building the application. We can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner's decisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward in time with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners ""more rope"" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order to achieve this, we will have the following constraints: The feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday's meeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L and positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous period. We will not, for example, be able to say things like ""In November, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw gas. What you should have done was..."" We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. This means that if the learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to start over at time period one. We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs, transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the right answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the decisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down any path he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, and the right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actually better if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has already calculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and conversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback we would have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well with the high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in this task. We cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq framework does not support the downloading of data into external applications. The technical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our current development budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learner on the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make the mistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices. If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of day Wednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of this simulation. I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please let me know if you would like to set up a meeting. Thank you.

Normal,"Please review. =20 Greg, After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de= ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg= arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20 Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis= tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe= nalty. This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision = of the plan. It also states that the account balance shall be determined a= s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re= ceives the written request of the participant. In my case this would be as= of September 30th. I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%= of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001. The plan administ= rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently. Their reading yield= s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St= ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of Enron Corp. sha= res in the account as of September 30, 2001. Their justification is that i= n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th= at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o= f Enron Corp. common stock. There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation. First,= section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.= "" This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se= ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no= t apply. Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib= ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay= ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution. The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3. If that = is the case then section 7.1 should apply. This section does provide for t= he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares. However, it states ""The val= ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin= g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay= ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".= This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every= share in the account on January 1, 2001. Although this would be the most = beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor= p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share, this methodology goes beyond se= ction 6.3. The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of= distribution under each of the three interpretations: Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1 Number of shar= es Relative share Phantom Stock 10% -600=09=09=09=09-54,866 Value to be shares=09=09=09$493,792 Current stock shares=09=09=0949,379 shares I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair. If the = administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7= .1 should apply. The current interpretation of the plan administrators is = a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. = =20 In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the= same issue.

Cc: McDaniel, Kirk; Coleman, Brad; O'rourke, Tim Subject: BRM Case & Options Importance: High Phillip, I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday. Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and 2nd cash flow impact. In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost. (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K) The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one. Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting. Also, I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions. I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time. We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses. One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow. Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization? Please consider the costs of finishing this project.

Normal,"Mike & Tony, Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs. Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close. I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis. I don't know if this would be agreeable to you. Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think. If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections. I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors. We are torn between two good locations. However, we are leaning towards Kerrville. The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially. We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to our plan to move to San Marcos. I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately. Phillip Allen 713-463-8626 pallen70@hotmail.com"

Normal,"Jim, Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating. Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low. Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith. I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at. Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time. Thank you anyway.

We'll be with family in Austin, and kind of on a maiden voyage in our '83 Avion that we're upgrading for camping! Here's a look at three post offices in a slightly different manner. Remember that the Roma one is about 5 years old, was a 15 yr lease originally. The other two are new. The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10 years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonus kicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease income after it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cash on cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma. We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us know if you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they will last long.

Normal,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's. Flying somewhere takes too much time."

Normal,"Jeff, I received the fax from Velasquez Masonry for $11,000. He is proposing to do work on nine buildings. From the memo from the city it sounds like 33,34,35, and 42 are the units that are at risk for collapse. I don't want to pay for any discretionary work. Also, I am still waiting for a quote from another mason. I am willing to offer $5,000 toward the repair and removal of rock in return for the release prepared by Jacques. With regard to the utilities I want to have them transferred on Monday the 21st. That will be one month that the utilities have been in my name. It needs to be clear that I will net that month's electric and water against the $5,000 for the rock. If she is willing to take the money for repairs we should be able to wrap things up immediately. If not we will have to continue negotiations, but the utilities still need to be transferred. Phillip"

Here are the main points from their conversation 1. Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already."" He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it."" He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best. He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court."" 2. Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B. The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle."" The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office. 3. New Generator Construction Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand. Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer."""

Normal,"Adrianne, Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, Emil Carlsson and Thomas Considine. Emil is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading position. I would recommend bringing Emil to Houston for further interviews based on his technical knowledge. The biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation. Thomas was working as an equity market maker. He is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise. He is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades. The trading track would be an excellent match for his desires. I would also recommend bringing Thomas to Houston for further consideration. Phillip"
Normal,"John, Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this. However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime. I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit. The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send? The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times. Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes. I know these are not your intended messages. I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR. We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing. My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000. The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation. Please consider these suggestions. We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance. Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning. Phillip"

We are hoping to supplement EMF's list of economists and economic modelers who are largely academics or with government labs or offices with folks from companies who can help shed some light on how companies anticipate markets will react to climate policies and the possible changes to prices and availability of cleaner fuels such as natural gas. A description of the 2-day program follows, and we can provide more information on the EMF meeting as well if that's helpful. I would be grateful if you can help identify someone at Enron -- or otherwise -- who you feel could both contribute to and benefit from the discussions with top economists and modelers. If you need more information, please feel free to call me or Leianne Clements (our economist) at the Pew Center number listed below. Thanks for considering, Vicki Arroyo Cochran Director of Policy Analysis The Economics of Natural Gas in the Climate Change Debate (August 9-10, 2001) Determining future demands and supply of natural gas (NG) are important in determining climate policies since burning NG is relatively ""cleaner"" than burning coal and oil. A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus accelerating its demand. However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to more ""dirty"" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax). The Pew Center has found that NG information is often extrapolated from that of oil. Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector, policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change problem. The Pew Center will host a conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University, to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining natural gas issues. A report will be published summarizing the topics discussed in the conference.

The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs actual of .79 2. Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91 3. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium. Aug. 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs actual of .99 2. Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49 3. Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the monthly postings 4. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium. Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against the index, as well as, spreads to other locations. Please call with any questions. Phillip"
Normal,"Suzanne, Can you give me more details or email the plan prior to meeting? What do I need to provide besides headcount? Otherwise any afternoon next week would be fine Phillip"
Normal,"Colleen, Please add Mike Grigsby to the distribution. On another note, do you have any idea how Patti is holding up? Phillip"
Normal,"Brad, With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an associate. Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a commercial manager. I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end. Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori. Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori. Let me know if there are any issues. Phillip"
Normal,"Bruce, Can you stop by and set up my reuters. Phillip"
Normal,"Lucy, The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better. See if you can add these modifications: 1. Use a formula in column E. Add the value in column C to column D. It should read =c6+d6. Then copy this formula to the rows below. 2. Column H needs a formula. Subtract amount paid from amount owed. =e6-g6. 3. Column F is filled with the #### sign. this is because the column width is too narrow. Use you mouse to click on the line beside the letter F. Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider. 4. After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond. Phillip"
Normal,"Lucy, I got your email with the attachment. Let's work together today to get this done Phillip"
Normal,you have my approval

Normal,"Lucy, We can discuss your email later. How is progress on creating the spreadsheets. You will probably need to close the file before you attach to an email. It is 2:00. I really want to make some progress on these two files. Phillip"
Normal,"Lucy, Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week. Then email the file back."
Normal,"Open the ""utility"" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1). You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months. If we have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper. Use the rates described in the spreadsheet. This is a great chance for you to practice excel."
Normal,"Mac, Thanks for the research report on EOG. Here are my observations: Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices: (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. I think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. Current price 37 Nat. Gas 34 Crude 10 Total 81 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate? To me this looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, Tosco, and SLB? Thank you, Phillip"
