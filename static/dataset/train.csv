Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want your print out to be on only one page. Use Print preview to see what your print out will look like before you print.

"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin.

"Reagan, I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on Friday, April 13th. However, my closing has been postponed. As I mentioned I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get back in touch with you once he is finished. Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager from San Antonio. For my first development project, I feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining FHA financing. We are working with Kipp Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings. Your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates. I am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships. I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan. Phillip Allen",Normal
"Jacques, The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows: Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 is outstanding. Kohutek- $2,150 Cuatro- $37,800 George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this amount. The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 appraisal and $2,375 engineering). I couldn't find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers. Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the sellers to be executed. Phillip",Normal
"John, Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter. Keith said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity. I still believe Frank should receive the same signing incentives as Keith. Phillip",Normal

While he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list. Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.

"Reagan, I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas? I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. I am not discounting those services. I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week. Phillip",Normal
"Cary, Here is the picture of the house I have in mind. I was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley. A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive. I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. Also the front porch would be smaller. I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.

"Reagan, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. Below is a list of questions on the specs: 1. Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine? Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5. Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial one out of iron. Only about 5 feet. 9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 A/C units? I am assuming 2. 12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron railings? 15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except for change orders? I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.

"Greg, Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates: Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable) What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent? Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit. Why is profit only 4%? Why are the architect fees up to $200K. I thought they would be $80K. What is the $617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high? Who receives the 2 points? How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us? Where is your 1%? Are you receiving one of the points on the loan? What is the status on the operating pro forma? My back of the envelope puts NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses.

"Jacques, The agreement looks fine. My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project"". Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them $1,300,000? I thought it was less. Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants. I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.

Thanks for the information. It would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned. I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this January. I have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock.

"Gentlemen, Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date. I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed. We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugo's number is 512-295-8052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used. Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday. We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project. Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward. Phillip",Normal

"Jacques, George finally sent me some information. Please look over his email. He wants us to buy him out. Keith and I think this is a joke. We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward. I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us. I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market. My version of a buyout is attached. I need your expert advise. I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose. Do they have a case that they are due money for their time? Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance. There isn't any time to waste so I want to respond to their offer asap. Call me with your thoughts.

Phillip Allen Keith Holst ENRON 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX? 77002-7361 Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout Dear Phillip and Keith: We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ? Sincerely, [IMAGE] ? ? ? George W. Richards President P.S.?????

"George, I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. I still have the concerns that I had last week. Specifically that the costs of our project are too high. I have gathered more information that support my concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total $10.4 Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million. We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million. We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to discuss alternatives. Phillip",Normal

"John, Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts? I will set up a room with Kim. Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen: 1. Review and document systems and processes - The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements. I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing scheduling in Unify are grey. 2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.

"Jaques, After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" fees of 10%. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process.

I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. The missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 2. #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 3. #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 4. #11 Missed on 2/2? 5. #13 Missed on 1/26? 6. #14 missed on 2/2? 7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19? 8. #20a missed on 2/2? 9. #35 missed on 2/2? My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on some of these. I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit. Will have some time today to work on a utility letter. Tried to call Wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.

"Jacques, Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? The key business points are: 1. Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours. We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted.

"Jeff, My target is to get $225 back out of the stage. Therefore, I could take a sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K. This would still only require $75K cash from the buyer. After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around $20K cash. You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email. Do you want to give the New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal. Phillip",Normal
"Jeff, I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. There are several reasons that I won't commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. Can you clarify the dates in the contract. Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer. If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list. Email or call me later today. Phillip",Normal

"Lucy, Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column. The other questions I had about last week's rent are: #15 Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26. What is going on? #25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

"George, The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.

"Jeff, Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. A 10% note actually attractive. See below. My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. Sales Price 705,000 1st Lien 473,500 2nd Lien 225,000 Transfer fee 7,500 Cash required 14,500 NOI 100,000 1st Lien 47,292 2nd Lien 23,694 Cash flow 29,014 Cash on cash 200% These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%.

"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""I was getting worried,"" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 Phillip",Normal

"Questions about 12/29 rentroll: There were two deposits that were not labeled. One for $150 and the other for $75. Which apartments? 20a or #13? Utility overages for #26 and #44? Where did you get these amounts? For what periods? What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. Is this right? Has the deposit been made yet? A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly. Phillip",Normal

"Jim, I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I described to you last week. The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos. There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved. As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee. If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required. I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing. I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks. I am faxing you a project summary. And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you.

Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property? Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned? Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights? What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing? I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and American Multifamily walking on this deal. So I just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can. Phillip",Normal
"Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. Specific questions should include: 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input. Phillip",Normal
