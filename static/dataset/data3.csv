Normal,"$100 for the yard seems like enough for up to 12.5 hours. How long did it take him? I think $100 should be enough. Use Page Setup under the File menu to change from Portrait to Landscape if you want to change from printing vertically to printing horizontally. Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want your print out to be on only one page. Use Print preview to see what your print out will look like before you print. The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles. A valve adjustment might do some good. It has idled very high for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.

Normal,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's. Flying somewhere takes too much time."

Normal,"Tim, Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz. He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract. On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May. It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170. Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected. The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary. Can you email or call with some additional insight? Thank you, Phillip"
Normal,"Gary, I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor. According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region. Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him. I believe he has sent you my plans. They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects. Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor? If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well? Thank you for your time. I am excited about potentially using your product. Phillip Allen"

The following assumptions were made to establish our bid: 5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees. Also an undiscounted June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid. Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions: $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year). Demand charges only. I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.

Normal,"Johnnie, Thank you for meeting with me on Friday. I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system. I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you. In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations. The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your framers install them may have to be considered. However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor. I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale. I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.

Normal,"Reagan, I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on Friday, April 13th. However, my closing has been postponed. As I mentioned I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get back in touch with you once he is finished. Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager from San Antonio. For my first development project, I feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining FHA financing. We are working with Kipp Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings. Your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates. I am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships. I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan. Phillip Allen"
Normal,"Jacques, The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows: Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 is outstanding. Kohutek- $2,150 Cuatro- $37,800 George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this amount. The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 appraisal and $2,375 engineering). I couldn't find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers. Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the sellers to be executed. Phillip"
Normal,"John, Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter. Keith said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity. I still believe Frank should receive the same signing incentives as Keith. Phillip"
Normal,"Thanks for the response. I think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step. I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the floor plan. He got back to me yesterday with his first draft. He took my plan and improved it. I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans. While he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list. Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.

Normal,Jacques I am out of the office for the rest of the week. Have you ever seen anyone miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks? I assure you this is unusual for me. Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday. Call me on my cell phone if you need me. Phillip
Normal,"Reagan, I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas? I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. I am not discounting those services. I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week. Phillip"
Normal,"Cary, Here is the picture of the house I have in mind. I was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley. A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive. I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. Also the front porch would be smaller. I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.

Normal,no problem
Normal,"Reagan, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. Below is a list of questions on the specs: 1. Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine? Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5. Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial one out of iron. Only about 5 feet. 9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 A/C units? I am assuming 2. 12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron railings? 15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except for change orders? I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up. I am going to call Cary Kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas. Phillip I"

Normal,"Jacques, Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect? They have both sent me agreements. The only payment that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect. I have written personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the engineer. I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership. I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me. Should I wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership. Let me know what you think. Phillip"

Normal,"Greg, Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates: Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable) What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent? Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit. Why is profit only 4%? Why are the architect fees up to $200K. I thought they would be $80K. What is the $617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high? Who receives the 2 points? How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us? Where is your 1%? Are you receiving one of the points on the loan? What is the status on the operating pro forma? My back of the envelope puts NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses.

Also let me know about the parking. The builder in San Marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code. The townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem. They probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms. Phillip"
Normal,keith holst sent you an email with the details.
Normal,"Jacques, The agreement looks fine. My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project"". Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them $1,300,000? I thought it was less. Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants. I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above. Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor. Phillip"

Normal,"Jacques, I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time. It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal). One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied. I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price. Can you help clear this up. Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released. Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities. On the other hand, conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was clean. What is your inclination? Call as soon as you have a chance to review. Phillip"

If you want to run an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine. I will write you a letter of recommendation. When do you need it? You can use me as a reference.

Normal,Thanks for the information. It would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned. I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this January. I have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock. I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be kept in enron stock (50%). Are you saying that all the previous grants have fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?

Normal,"Gentlemen, Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date. I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed. We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugo's number is 512-295-8052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used. Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday. We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project. Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward. Phillip"
Normal,Here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format. The summary presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions.
Normal,"Jacques, George finally sent me some information. Please look over his email. He wants us to buy him out. Keith and I think this is a joke. We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward. I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us. I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market. My version of a buyout is attached. I need your expert advise. I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose. Do they have a case that they are due money for their time? Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance. There isn't any time to waste so I want to respond to their offer asap. Call me with your thoughts.

Phillip Allen Keith Holst ENRON 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX? 77002-7361 Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout Dear Phillip and Keith: We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ? Sincerely, [IMAGE] ? ? ? George W. Richards President P.S.?????

Normal,"George, I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. I still have the concerns that I had last week. Specifically that the costs of our project are too high. I have gathered more information that support my concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total $10.4 Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.

Stop trying to collect the $95 in question. #33 Missed rent. Are they still there? #26 I see that she paid a deposit. But the file says she moved in on 1/30. Has she ever paid rent? I can't find any on the last three deposits. #44 Have the paid for February? There is no payment since the beginning of the year. #33 You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit? The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent. I need you to figure these out immediately. I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll in case you need to research these questions. I will not be in the office next week.

Normal,"John, Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts? I will set up a room with Kim. Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen: 1. Review and document systems and processes - The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements. I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing scheduling in Unify are grey. 2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts. Are we looking at everything we should? Putting a person with a trading mentality should add some value and direction to the group. In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD to work part time to get it done. Phillip"

Normal,"Jaques, After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" fees of 10%. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for only true costs + 1.4 million. Phillip"

Normal,"Lucy, Thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file. Moving on to 2/9, here are some questions: #1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110. I can't tell if he still owes $47 on his deposit. #13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140. #15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95. Hopefully, he won't have a bad reaction. #20b Missed rent? #26 Has she paid any deposit or rent? #27 Missed rent?"

Normal,"Lucy, Here is the rentroll for this Friday. Sorry it is so late. There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 1. I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. The missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 2. #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 3. #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 4. #11 Missed on 2/2? 5. #13 Missed on 1/26? 6. #14 missed on 2/2? 7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19? 8. #20a missed on 2/2? 9. #35 missed on 2/2? My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on some of these. I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit. Will have some time today to work on a utility letter. Tried to call Wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him. Will try again today. I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer. Did you meet them? If so, what did you think? Phillip"
Normal,I will email you an updated operating statement with Nov and Dec tomorrow morning. What did the seguin doctor think of the place. How much could I get the stagecoach appraised for? Do you still do appraisals? Could it be valued on an 11 or 12 cap?
Normal,"Jacques, Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? The key business points are: 1. Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours. We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted. Let me know if you can draft these agreements. The GP issue may need some tweaking. Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com"
Normal,"Lucy, Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save. My only questions are: 1. Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 12/01. Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the beginning of the two week period. What is going on? 2. Gilbert in #27-is he just late? Here is a file for 12/08."

Normal,Send it to Ina Rangel she can forward it to appropriate traders. There are too many to list individually
Normal,"Jeff, My target is to get $225 back out of the stage. Therefore, I could take a sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K. This would still only require $75K cash from the buyer. After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around $20K cash. You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email. Do you want to give the New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal. Phillip"
Normal,"Jeff, I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. There are several reasons that I won't commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. Can you clarify the dates in the contract. Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer. If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list. Email or call me later today. Phillip"

Normal,"Lucy, Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column. The other questions I had about last week's rent are: #15 Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26. What is going on? #25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend. Phillip"

Normal,"George, The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for. I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. Call or email to let me know if this would work for you. pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work) Phillip Allen PS.

Normal,"Jeff, Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. A 10% note actually attractive. See below. My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. Sales Price 705,000 1st Lien 473,500 2nd Lien 225,000 Transfer fee 7,500 Cash required 14,500 NOI 100,000 1st Lien 47,292 2nd Lien 23,694 Cash flow 29,014 Cash on cash 200% These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%. This doesn't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price. Do you want to reconsider? Let me know. Phillip"

I have about $225K invested in the stagecoach, it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven. I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee and Jaques Craig can work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a second lien. I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%. Checkout this spreadsheet. These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes. However, I am very concerned about the way it is being shown. Having Lucy show it is not a good idea. I need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property.

Normal,"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""I was getting worried,"" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

Normal,Thanks for representing Matt. Phillip
Normal,"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 Phillip"
Normal,"Lucy, Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages. There are alot of overages. It will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather. You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap. This needs to be handwritten on all new leases. I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet. We also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap. I will write something today. Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start collecting. Phillip"

Normal,"Questions about 12/29 rentroll: There were two deposits that were not labeled. One for $150 and the other for $75. Which apartments? 20a or #13? Utility overages for #26 and #44? Where did you get these amounts? For what periods? What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. Is this right? Has the deposit been made yet? A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly. Phillip"

Regarding the financing, I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston. I have sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information on you. Can you please send it to him. His contact information is: phone (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net. I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information. I hope to pull that together this afternoon. I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document. He was positive about his experience overall. He did not seem pleased with the bookkeeping or information flow to the investor. I think we should discuss these procedures in advance. Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur. Phillip"
Normal,"Jim, I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I described to you last week. The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos. There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved. As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee. If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required. I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing. I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks. I am faxing you a project summary. And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you. Let me know what else you need. The land is scheduled to close mid January. Phillip Allen"
Normal,"Jeff, Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th. I have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow. When will more money be required? Escrow for roads? Utility connections? Other rezoning costs? What about property taxes? The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I owned it. Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property? Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned? Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights? What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing? I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and American Multifamily walking on this deal. So I just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can. Phillip"
Normal,"Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. Specific questions should include: 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input. Phillip"

Normal,"George, The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive. I have one other investor in addition to Keith that has interest. Some additional background information on Larry and yourself would be helpful. Background Questions: Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in Creekside. Please list projects completed during the last 5 years. Include the project description, investors, business entity, Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors. Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects. With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the investors. Preferable Investment Structure: Developers guarantee note, not investors. Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing. Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns. Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now. These questions are not intended to be offensive in any way. It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that leads to future opportunities. I am happy to provide you with any information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner. Sincerely, Phillip Allen"

According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal. At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell $172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00. ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower."" Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees, and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend. Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday. ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader. At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased $206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday. PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled to restart this weekend. At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at $325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday. -Robert Scalabrino PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and falling natural gas prices, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $62.00-$76.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday. ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of the morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expiration the market had pretty much dried up."" Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main reason for the decline in spot market prices. Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of $2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts indicated reduced utility load requirements. In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets. Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13 higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the $67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00- $92.00. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said. The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19 to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the market opened down to $59.00 after options expired. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17 lower at $65.00-$100.00. Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively. Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired generation to meet increased weather-related demand. Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu. ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got people coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are much more realistic prices."" Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00 yesterday. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00. ""What's happening is the people who don't have firm transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those high prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said. ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices fell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices, causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was forecast for the region this week, traders said. Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week. ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said one southern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in the north."" Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour. ""Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as forecasts came out,"" said on Entergy power trader. ""Prices, declined to $60 and less."" The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95 to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent estimates. Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week caused prices to decline in the region. In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was the main culprit behind lower prices. ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utility trader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill. Yesterday, it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold."" Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday. -Brian Whary U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to increase household consumption for space heating, traders said. The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01 pounds a megawatt-hour. Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15 pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday. December continued to fall amid a combination of position closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said. December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade. First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue to stifle demand, traders said. January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence. First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close. Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer 2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour. Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a megawatt-hour. Open positions on many short-term structures will likely force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run- up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more easily be assessed. -Nick Livingstone Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said. Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt- hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076 megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446 megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing. Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating. Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders said. ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" a Stockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have been selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price."" Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S. The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict temperatures to begin falling. Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22 percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell 4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts. Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week. Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter- term contracts. Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour, 1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers to meet the increased demand, other traders said. Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor, will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said. Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said. -Nick Livingstone -0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf"

Normal,"Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal. Sincerely, Phillip Allen"

What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and liabilities)? Who owns the land? improvements? Who holds the various loans? Is the land collateral? Investment What happens to initial investment? Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans? Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule? Investment Return Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment? Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan? Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans? Looks like it from the cash flow statement. Terms of each loan? Uses of Funds How will disbursements be made? By whom? What type of bank account? Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors? Reports to track expenses vs plan? Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project? Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals? Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names? These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me. Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process. Phillip"

Normal,"Mark, Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal basis and socal/san juan spreads. I listed the days during bidweek that reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints before and after bidweek. The following observations can be made: July 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs actual of .79 2. Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91 3. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium. Aug. 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs actual of .99 2. Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49 3. Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the monthly postings 4. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium. Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against the index, as well as, spreads to other locations. Please call with any questions. Phillip"

Normal,"Brad, With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an associate. Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a commercial manager. I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end. Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori. Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori. Let me know if there are any issues. Phillip"

Normal,"Lucy, The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better. See if you can add these modifications: 1. Use a formula in column E. Add the value in column C to column D. It should read =c6+d6. Then copy this formula to the rows below. 2. Column H needs a formula. Subtract amount paid from amount owed. =e6-g6. 3. Column F is filled with the #### sign. this is because the column width is too narrow. Use you mouse to click on the line beside the letter F. Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider. 4. After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond. Phillip"

This is a great chance for you to practice excel."
Normal,"Mac, Thanks for the research report on EOG. Here are my observations: Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices: (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. I think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. Current price 37 Nat. Gas 34 Crude 10 Total 81 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate? To me this looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, Tosco, and SLB? Thank you, Phillip"

(Reminder) Update GIS Information This is a reminder !!! If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS information, please do so. It is essential that this function be performed as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to call Ted Bland @ 3-5275. With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees between operating companies and new ventures. To do this it is essential to have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee data. In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the Enron VP/MD PRC requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education need to be completed via the HR Global Information System. HRGIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet. Just go to hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link. Or just type eglobal.enron.com on the command line of your browser. The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July. If you would like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please contact Kathy Schultea at x33841. Your timely response to this request is greatly appreciated. Thanks, Dave"

Normal,"Scott, I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company. I think I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from him. Basically, they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider. Then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk. This is my best guess. I will get back to you with more. Phillip"

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management. In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That risk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity. As to the asset management: do you have any preference on structure? Are there elements that you would like to see? Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Laird"

Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want your print out to be on only one page. Use Print preview to see what your print out will look like before you print.

Normal,"Folks, I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement - that I think will be interesting to the group. I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00 - a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete. I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash - structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks. Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book. <A Concrete Research by David Moore</A> Regards, Harry Francis"

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt- hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range. ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader. According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight. At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank $202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range. Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage that began March 31. At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00. According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling demand 84 percent below normal. ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader. At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at $175.00-$228.00. According the California Independent System Operator today's forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743 megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. -Robert Scalabrino Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in available generation coupled with less weather-related demand, caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said. According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri, temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively. In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from Friday. ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week long."" Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000 megawatts through Friday. Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to hit the grid tomorrow. Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 nuclear power facilities. The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1 at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned and operated by Niagara Mohawk. Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to $58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to $51.25 and $40.00 indices. ~ -Karyn Rispoli Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast, traders said. ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said. ""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of that."" The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25 when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired. Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00 and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the Southeast was expected to remain high into next week. Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at $28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee, forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday. ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an ECAR trader said. In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up, though traders said transmission problems limited volume. Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50, and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with trades from $32.00-$40.00. Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs. For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern half of the region at $45.00-$52.00. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska. ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said. ""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said. Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is expected to begin Wednesday. Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity, temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week, propelling air conditioning demand, traders said. The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20. Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50. On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range. In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000. ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader. ""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree (Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is 85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us."" On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at $35-$36. Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC. Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range. In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders said. On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades were noted. -Brian Whary U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K. fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling interest, traders said. Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than Friday. The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting price levels, traders said. Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said. June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour. On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15 pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since the start of last week. Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements. Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels, they said. -Amal Halawi Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid limited hydro-supply, traders said. Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00 megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50- 214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour. ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo- based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are steadily climbing.'' Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters. Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet outlooks.'' Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour, down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year. Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour with 140 megawatts exchanged. Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours. -Alejandro Barbajosa -0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT =0F$ - daily.pdf"

Normal,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's. Flying somewhere takes too much time."

Normal,"Phillip--To the extent that we can give Chair Hoecker our spin on the reasons for the hikes, we would like to. The Commission is getting calls from legislators, DOE, etc. about the prices and is going to have to provide some response. Better if it coincides with Enron's view and is not anti-market.

Normal,Send to Karen Buckley. Trading track interview to be conducted in May.
Normal,"Tim, Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz. He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract. On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May. It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170. Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected. The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary. Can you email or call with some additional insight? Thank you, Phillip"
Normal,I would look at properties in San Antonio or Dallas.
Normal,"Gary, I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor. According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region. Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him. I believe he has sent you my plans. They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects. Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor? If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well? Thank you for your time. I am excited about potentially using your product. Phillip Allen"
Normal,"Ray, Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy. Which delivery points from which publication will be used? Basically, can you help us get any clarification on the language ""the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California""? Phillip"
Normal,"Ned, Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value. The following assumptions were made to establish our bid: 5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees. Also an undiscounted June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid. Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions: $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year). Demand charges only. I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not. Please call or email with comments. Phillip Allen"

In addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front. A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.

Normal,"Johnnie, Thank you for meeting with me on Friday. I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system. I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you. In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations. The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your framers install them may have to be considered. However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor. I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale. I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built. Please email your cost estimates when complete. Thank you, Phillip Allen"

Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager from San Antonio. For my first development project, I feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining FHA financing. We are working with Kipp Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings. Your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates. I am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships. I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan. Phillip Allen"
Normal,"Jacques, The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows: Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 is outstanding.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 appraisal and $2,375 engineering). I couldn't find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers. Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the sellers to be executed. Phillip"
Normal,"John, Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter. Keith said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity. I still believe Frank should receive the same signing incentives as Keith. Phillip"
Normal,"Thanks for the response. I think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step. I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the floor plan.

While he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list. Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.

Normal,"Lucy, Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save. My only questions are: 1. Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 12/01. Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the beginning of the two week period. What is going on? 2. Gilbert in #27-is he just late? Here is a file for 12/08."

Normal,Jacques I am out of the office for the rest of the week. Have you ever seen anyone miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks? I assure you this is unusual for me. Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday. Call me on my cell phone if you need me. Phillip
Normal,"Reagan, I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas? I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. I am not discounting those services. I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week. Phillip"
Normal,"Cary, Here is the picture of the house I have in mind. I was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley. A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive. I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. Also the front porch would be smaller. I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.

I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. Also the front porch would be smaller. I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.

Normal,no problem
Normal,"Reagan, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. Below is a list of questions on the specs: 1. Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine? Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5. Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial one out of iron. Only about 5 feet. 9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 A/C units? I am assuming 2. 12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron railings? 15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except for change orders? I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up. I am going to call Cary Kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas. Phillip I"

Normal,"Jacques, Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect? They have both sent me agreements. The only payment that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect. I have written personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the engineer. I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership. I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me. Should I wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership. Let me know what you think. Phillip"

Normal,"Greg, Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates: Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable) What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent? Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit. Why is profit only 4%? Why are the architect fees up to $200K. I thought they would be $80K. What is the $617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high? Who receives the 2 points? How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us? Where is your 1%? Are you receiving one of the points on the loan? What is the status on the operating pro forma? My back of the envelope puts NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses.

Also let me know about the parking. The builder in San Marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code. The townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem. They probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms. Phillip"
Normal,keith holst sent you an email with the details.
Normal,"Jacques, The agreement looks fine. My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project"". Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them $1,300,000? I thought it was less. Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants. I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above. Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor. Phillip"

It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal). One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied. I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price. Can you help clear this up. Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.

Normal,"Gentlemen, Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date. I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed. We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugo's number is 512-295-8052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used. Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday. We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project. Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward. Phillip"
Normal,Here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format. The summary presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions.
Normal,"Jacques, George finally sent me some information. Please look over his email. He wants us to buy him out. Keith and I think this is a joke. We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward. I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us. I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market. My version of a buyout is attached. I need your expert advise. I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose. Do they have a case that they are due money for their time? Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance. There isn't any time to waste so I want to respond to their offer asap. Call me with your thoughts.

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ? Sincerely, [IMAGE] ? ? ? George W. Richards President P.S.?????

Normal,"George, I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. I still have the concerns that I had last week. Specifically that the costs of our project are too high. I have gathered more information that support my concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total $10.4 Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million. We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million. We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to discuss alternatives. Phillip"

Normal,"Lucy, Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll: #2 Has she actually paid the $150 deposit. Her move in date was 2/6. It is not on any rentroll that I can see. #9 Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she will start paying on #9 #15 Since he has been such a good tenant for so long. Stop trying to collect the $95 in question. #33 Missed rent. Are they still there? #26 I see that she paid a deposit. But the file says she moved in on 1/30. Has she ever paid rent? I can't find any on the last three deposits. #44 Have the paid for February? There is no payment since the beginning of the year. #33 You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit? The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent. I need you to figure these out immediately. I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll in case you need to research these questions. I will not be in the office next week.

Normal,"John, Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts? I will set up a room with Kim. Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen: 1. Review and document systems and processes - The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements. I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing scheduling in Unify are grey. 2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts. Are we looking at everything we should? Putting a person with a trading mentality should add some value and direction to the group. In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD to work part time to get it done. Phillip"

Normal,"Jaques, After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" fees of 10%. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for only true costs + 1.4 million. Phillip"

Normal,"Lucy, Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps. I wrote it as if it were from you. It should come from the manager. It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there unit is when they move in. This needs to be written in on their lease. When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up. Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out. You guys can make changes if you need to. Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators. We have to get this done next week.

Normal,"Lucy, Here is the rentroll for this Friday. Sorry it is so late. There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 1. I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. The missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 2. #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 3. #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 4. #11 Missed on 2/2? 5. #13 Missed on 1/26? 6. #14 missed on 2/2? 7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19? 8. #20a missed on 2/2? 9. #35 missed on 2/2? My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on some of these. I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit. Will have some time today to work on a utility letter. Tried to call Wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him. Will try again today. I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer. Did you meet them? If so, what did you think? Phillip"

Normal,"Jacques, Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? The key business points are: 1. Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours. We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted.

Normal,"Jeff, My target is to get $225 back out of the stage. Therefore, I could take a sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K. This would still only require $75K cash from the buyer. After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around $20K cash. You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email. Do you want to give the New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal. Phillip"
Normal,"Jeff, I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. There are several reasons that I won't commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. Can you clarify the dates in the contract. Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer. If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list. Email or call me later today. Phillip"

Normal,"Lucy, Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column. The other questions I had about last week's rent are: #15 Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26. What is going on? #25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend. Phillip"

Normal,"George, The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for. I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. Call or email to let me know if this would work for you. pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work) Phillip Allen PS. Channel 2 in Houston ran a story yesterday (Feb. 2) about a home in Kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls.

Normal,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's. Flying somewhere takes too much time."

Also an undiscounted June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid. Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions: $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year). Demand charges only. I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.

I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you. In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations. The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your framers install them may have to be considered. However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor. I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale. I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.

Normal,"Dave, The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped from the Office of the Chairman. Is your understanding that the West desk will receive origination each month based on the schedule below. The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as follows: October 2000 $1,395,000 November 2000 $1,350,000 December 2000 $1,395,000 January 2001 $ 669,600 February 2001 $ 604,800 March 2001 $ 669,600 April 2001 $ 648,000 May 2001 $ 669,600 June 2001 $ 648,000 July 2001 $ 669,600 August 2001 $ 669,600 September 2001 $ 648,000 October 2001 $ 669,600 November 2001 $ 648,000 December 2001 $ 669,600 This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by the Denver desk. The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day (Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01). The ENA Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense. Let me know if you disagree. Phillip"
Normal,"Larry, It sounds like Claudia and Jacques are almost finished with the documents. There is one item of which I was unsure. Was an environmental report prepared before the original purchase? If yes, shouldn't it be listed as an asset of the partnership and your costs be recovered? Phillip"
Normal,"Lucy, The spreadsheet looks fine to me. Phillip"
Normal,"Bruce, Thank you for your bid. I have decided on a floor plan. I am going to have an architect in Austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed specification list. I will send you that detailed plan and spec list when complete for a final bid. Probably in early to mid June. Phillip"

Normal,"Reagan, I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on Friday, April 13th. However, my closing has been postponed. As I mentioned I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get back in touch with you once he is finished. Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager from San Antonio. For my first development project, I feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining FHA financing. We are working with Kipp Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings. Your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates. I am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships. I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan. Phillip Allen"
Normal,"Jacques, The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit ""B"" are as follows: Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 is outstanding. Kohutek- $2,150 Cuatro- $37,800 George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this amount. The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 appraisal and $2,375 engineering). I couldn't find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers. Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the sellers to be executed. Phillip"
Normal,"Steve, Thank you for the update. The need is still great for this disk space. Phillip"
Normal,"John, Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter. Keith said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity. I still believe Frank should receive the same signing incentives as Keith. Phillip"
Normal,"Thanks for the response. I think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step. I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the floor plan. He got back to me yesterday with his first draft. He took my plan and improved it. I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans. While he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list. Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners. I will be in San Marcos on Friday April 13th. Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through that day? Also can you provide some references?

Normal,Jacques I am out of the office for the rest of the week. Have you ever seen anyone miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks? I assure you this is unusual for me. Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday. Call me on my cell phone if you need me. Phillip
Normal,"Reagan, I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing? Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans? Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas? I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. I am not discounting those services. I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week. Phillip"
Normal,"Cary, Here is the picture of the house I have in mind. I was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near Wimberley. A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive. I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. Also the front porch would be smaller. I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.

Normal,"Reagan, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. Below is a list of questions on the specs: 1. Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine? Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5. Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial one out of iron. Only about 5 feet. 9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 A/C units? I am assuming 2. 12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron railings? 15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except for change orders? I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up. I am going to call Cary Kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas. Phillip I"

Normal,"Jacques, Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect? They have both sent me agreements. The only payment that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect. I have written personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the engineer. I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership. I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me. Should I wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership. Let me know what you think. Phillip"

Normal,"Greg, Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates: Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable) What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent? Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit. Why is profit only 4%? Why are the architect fees up to $200K. I thought they would be $80K. What is the $617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high? Who receives the 2 points? How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us? Where is your 1%? Are you receiving one of the points on the loan? What is the status on the operating pro forma? My back of the envelope puts NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses. After debt service that would only leave $122K. The coverage would only be 1.16. Talk to you this afternoon. Phillip"

Normal,"Greg, Something that I forgot to ask you. Do you know if Hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks? Also let me know about the parking. The builder in San Marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code. The townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem. They probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms. Phillip"
Normal,keith holst sent you an email with the details.
Normal,"Jacques, The agreement looks fine. My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project"". Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them $1,300,000? I thought it was less. Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants. I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above. Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor. Phillip"

Normal,"Jacques, I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time. It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal). One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied. I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price. Can you help clear this up. Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released. Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities. On the other hand, conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was clean. What is your inclination? Call as soon as you have a chance to review. Phillip"

Normal,Thanks for the information. It would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned. I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this January. I have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock. I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be kept in enron stock (50%). Are you saying that all the previous grants have fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account? Thank you for looking into this issue. Phillip

Normal,"Gentlemen, Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date. I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed. We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugo's number is 512-295-8052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used. Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday. We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project. Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward. Phillip"
Normal,Here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format. The summary presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions.
Normal,"Jacques, George finally sent me some information. Please look over his email. He wants us to buy him out. Keith and I think this is a joke. We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward. I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us. I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market. My version of a buyout is attached. I need your expert advise. I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose. Do they have a case that they are due money for their time? Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance. There isn't any time to waste so I want to respond to their offer asap. Call me with your thoughts.

Phillip Allen Keith Holst ENRON 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX? 77002-7361 Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout Dear Phillip and Keith: We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ? Sincerely, [IMAGE] ? ? ? George W. Richards President P.S.?????

Normal,"George, I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. I still have the concerns that I had last week. Specifically that the costs of our project are too high. I have gathered more information that support my concerns. Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million Land 1.15 Interim Financing .85 Common Areas .80 Total $10.4 Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties. It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million. We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million. We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to discuss alternatives. Phillip"

Stop trying to collect the $95 in question. #33 Missed rent. Are they still there? #26 I see that she paid a deposit. But the file says she moved in on 1/30. Has she ever paid rent? I can't find any on the last three deposits. #44 Have the paid for February? There is no payment since the beginning of the year. #33 You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit? The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent. I need you to figure these out immediately.

Normal,"George, The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive. I have one other investor in addition to Keith that has interest. Some additional background information on Larry and yourself would be helpful. Background Questions: Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in Creekside. Please list projects completed during the last 5 years. Include the project description, investors, business entity, Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors. Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects. With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the investors. Preferable Investment Structure: Developers guarantee note, not investors. Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing. Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns. Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now. These questions are not intended to be offensive in any way. It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that leads to future opportunities. I am happy to provide you with any information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner. Sincerely, Phillip Allen"

Normal,"John, Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts? I will set up a room with Kim. Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen: 1. Review and document systems and processes - The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements. I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing scheduling in Unify are grey. 2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts. Are we looking at everything we should? Putting a person with a trading mentality should add some value and direction to the group. In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD to work part time to get it done. Phillip"

Normal,"Jaques, After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" fees of 10%. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for only true costs + 1.4 million. Phillip"

Normal,Forward Reg Dickson's resume to Ted Bland for consideration for the trading track program. He is overqualified and I'm sure too expensive to fill the scheduling position I have available. I will work with Cournie Parker to evaluate the other resumes. Phillip
Normal,"Lucy, Thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file. Moving on to 2/9, here are some questions: #1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110. I can't tell if he still owes $47 on his deposit. #13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140. #15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95. Hopefully, he won't have a bad reaction. #20b Missed rent? #26 Has she paid any deposit or rent? #27 Missed rent?"

Normal,"Lucy, Here is the 2/2 rentroll. The total does not equal the bank deposit. Your earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35. But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to. If the answer to this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and send it back. Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday. I will probably send you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll. Let's get this stuff clean today. Phillip"

Normal,"Lucy, Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps. I wrote it as if it were from you. It should come from the manager. It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there unit is when they move in. This needs to be written in on their lease. When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up. Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out. You guys can make changes if you need to. Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators. We have to get this done next week.

Normal,"Lucy, Here is the rentroll for this Friday. Sorry it is so late. There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 1. I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. The missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 2. #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 3. #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 4. #11 Missed on 2/2? 5. #13 Missed on 1/26? 6. #14 missed on 2/2? 7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19? 8. #20a missed on 2/2? 9. #35 missed on 2/2? My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on some of these. I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit. Will have some time today to work on a utility letter. Tried to call Wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him. Will try again today. I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer. Did you meet them? If so, what did you think? Phillip"
Normal,I will email you an updated operating statement with Nov and Dec tomorrow morning. What did the seguin doctor think of the place. How much could I get the stagecoach appraised for? Do you still do appraisals? Could it be valued on an 11 or 12 cap?
Normal,"Jacques, Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? The key business points are: 1. Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3. The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours. We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted. Let me know if you can draft these agreements. The GP issue may need some tweaking. Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com"

Normal,Send it to Ina Rangel she can forward it to appropriate traders. There are too many to list individually
Normal,"Jeff, My target is to get $225 back out of the stage. Therefore, I could take a sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K. This would still only require $75K cash from the buyer. After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around $20K cash. You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email. Do you want to give the New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal. Phillip"
Normal,"Jeff, I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. There are several reasons that I won't commit to this. Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the property. Interest rates may be lower. I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. Can you clarify the dates in the contract. Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer. If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list. Email or call me later today. Phillip"

Frequently, she would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package. All the traders came to depend on the information Patti provided. This information has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size of the west desk positions. Please call to discuss cash award. Phillip"

Normal,"Lucy, Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column. The other questions I had about last week's rent are: #15 Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26. What is going on? #25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend. Phillip"

Normal,"George, The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for. I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. Call or email to let me know if this would work for you. pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work) Phillip Allen PS.

Normal,"Richard, Are you available at 5:30 ET today? Phillip"
Normal,"Jeff, Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. A 10% note actually attractive. See below. My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. Sales Price 705,000 1st Lien 473,500 2nd Lien 225,000 Transfer fee 7,500 Cash required 14,500 NOI 100,000 1st Lien 47,292 2nd Lien 23,694 Cash flow 29,014 Cash on cash 200% These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%. This doesn't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price. Do you want to reconsider? Let me know. Phillip"

Normal,"Jeff, That is good news about Leander. Now for the stage. I would like to get it sold by the end of March. I have about $225K invested in the stagecoach, it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven. I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee and Jaques Craig can work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a second lien. I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%. Checkout this spreadsheet. These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes. However, I am very concerned about the way it is being shown. Having Lucy show it is not a good idea. I need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property.

Normal,"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""I was getting worried,"" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

Normal,Thanks for representing Matt. Phillip
Normal,"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 Phillip"
Normal,"Lucy, Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages. There are alot of overages. It will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather. You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap. This needs to be handwritten on all new leases. I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet. We also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap. I will write something today. Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start collecting. Phillip"

Phillip Allen pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041"
Normal,"Questions about 12/29 rentroll: There were two deposits that were not labeled. One for $150 and the other for $75. Which apartments? 20a or #13? Utility overages for #26 and #44? Where did you get these amounts? For what periods? What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank. Is this right? Has the deposit been made yet? A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly. Phillip"

There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved. As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee. If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required. I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing. I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks. I am faxing you a project summary. And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you.

Normal,"Jeff, Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th. I have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow. When will more money be required? Escrow for roads? Utility connections? Other rezoning costs? What about property taxes? The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I owned it. Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property? Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned? Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights? What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing? I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and American Multifamily walking on this deal. So I just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can. Phillip"
Normal,"Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. This creates a shortage in later months. 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. Specific questions should include: 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system. I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. Call me if you need any more input. Phillip"

Normal,raincheck?
Normal,"Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and October gas daily. It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers. I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business. Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal. Sincerely, Phillip Allen"

Normal,"George, Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate project: Ownership Structure What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner? What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and liabilities)? Who owns the land? improvements? Who holds the various loans? Is the land collateral? Investment What happens to initial investment? Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans? Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule? Investment Return Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment? Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan? Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans? Looks like it from the cash flow statement. Terms of each loan? Uses of Funds How will disbursements be made? By whom? What type of bank account? Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors? Reports to track expenses vs plan? Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project? Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals? Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names? These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me. Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process. Phillip"

Normal,"George, Here sales numbers from Reagan: As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot. The 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling. At 2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units under construction. I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way. The price I am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date. Let me know what you think. I will follow up with an email and phone call about Cherry Creek. I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was rejected on the De Ville property. Phillip Allen"

Normal,"Folks, I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement - that I think will be interesting to the group. I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00 - a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete. I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash - structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks. Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book. <A Concrete Research by David Moore</A> Regards, Harry Francis"

Pira certainly commands a lot of respect these days. Too much, probably.

The spread game is very different than playing crude. These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.

We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR. It looks as if during the month of June, the book administor loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but assigned multiple master deal ID's. (the code is ""NG-OPT-XL-PRC"") For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June: June 1st $797 million dollars loss June 2nd +192 million dollars made June 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..) This problem makes it impossible to backtest.... Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily increasing your limit to $45 million. This limit increase is in effect until July 26th. The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution can be devised..... I hope this helps.

I assume it is the former, not the latter. Is this correct? Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter? Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know. Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.

From: Gary Taylor 10/05/2000 07:25 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Griffith/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: SMUD deal Asian options John(s), How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published? or will it triple count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a similar calculation on weekends). I assume it is the former, not the latter. Is this correct? Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter? Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know. Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD. SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to argue for one or the other. Regards, Gary x31511"
Normal,"Adam: Good question. The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly identical product. The fight is over which execution model is superior. I would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct. It's happened in Europe already. The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry. Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically. I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct. The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful. It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

Thank you for the dinner last night. I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people in a more relaxed setting. During out conversation yesterday, I was confused about a point you made. You stated that you spent most of your time on the phone with Traders in New York. When you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron Online? I think the underlying question that I am asking, is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job, or is it meant to bypass traders completely. Thanks again for your time and for dinner.

Normal,"Russell: I think I should give you a little background on small ventures. Bill Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship. He is an extremely creative individual. Whalley actually commented on him today as someone ""who thinks outside the box"". Bill actually sat in a bar four years and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth. He has been successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas. As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron. He throws out ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one. He pointed out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for Enron. In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within reason. I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be considered a high priority. I am willing to accept some of the credit risk exposure as a cost of doing business. Bill understands his role as an independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for someone with finite capital. I place very high confidence in Bill not conducting high risk trades. Having said that, we certainly need to monitor his credit exposure and continue to require LC's. Just understand that he is at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade counterparty. I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread option he traded. He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the trading desk, knew it as well. There are a couple isolated products that Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations. This was one product. Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing models created by the research group. The problem with these models is that they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental price limitations. For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within variable cost than the models predict. Thus it is necessary to apply a correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used. Obviously, we have this function in our pricing models. I was not aware this methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models. This has since been changed. Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products. Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to Enron. I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting credit. I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade considering the circumstances. If you believe differently, please advise. Thanks, John"

It really shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange. One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products. I set up a new product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.

Normal,"I'm not sure what is happening on my position. It may have to do with how you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level. My VAR is so dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could produce that effect. The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into the winter.

From: Frank Hayden @ ENRON 09/15/2000 06:32 PM To: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sunil Dalal/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Stress Test The below file shows the results of the two stress test requested. Under the $7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price curves proportionally shifted. Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly. Key findings include: $7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79% $9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the financial desk actually decreased. This would seem to imply that up to the seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces risk). But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and increasing VaR by 74%. Does this make sense or is something else happening?

Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour. Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading session unless specified otherwise. 2. Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size. When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...). I could not overwrite the quantity to be 15,000. 3. Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system saying error trade, price not available. 4.

Normal,"I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today. MG clears their own trades and maybe some for other customers. He indicated that his cost for clearing is $3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher clearing rate and getting access to financing. This is a question I hope your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer. Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin costs."

Normal,"Please take me off your email list Jennifer Green <jgreen@aedc.org> on 09/01/2000 02:50:03 PM To: ""AEDC Members"":; cc: Subject: data standards Dear AEDC Member, One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arena is the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard. This standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and examining data. Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more comparable than ever before. A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to see how the data standards can be made to work for you. There are 25 tables in the standard presented in an excel format. The tabs at the bottom of the page will access the additional tables. You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for the standards. ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which approach works best for you. Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic development profession. They should be of particular advantage to the many areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't received the consideration they deserve. The standards are a great way to tell their story.

If so, what level of person? 2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001? 3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center? 4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want to plan for? 5) Are you expecting any promotions? 6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement agencies? Would we need to plan relocation costs for them? 7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries? 8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should plan for? If so, how much and where? 9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, monitors and software? 10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.) My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished before Paula Harris took over.

Normal,"Just some feedback on our EOL discussion. Whalley had similar thoughts about how to address the ICE issue. His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we post 1/8 on ICE. If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75. If someone betters that to 2 bid, we immediately go 2.25 bid. So we are always the best market on ICE so long as it is not inside our EOL 2-way. Thus the only way our best market shows on ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market gets shown. If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid. Our proposal was that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25. Think about which system you like better. Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will be implemented shortly. I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing a product this week. The purpose will be to communicate about the importance of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 2-ways and killing the broker markets."

Thank You, Ina Rangel ---------------------- Forwarded by Ina Rangel/HOU/ECT on 08/22/2000 01:56 PM --------------------------- Sarah Bolken@ENRON 08/22/2000 08:17 AM Sent by: Sara Bolken@ENRON To: Ina Rangel/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: ENA Fileplan Project Ina, here is information concerning the scope and purpose of our project: We are records and information management consultants from Millican & Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we're taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic inventory of each ENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then ask that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff. There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be maintained. Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and then use the ""imaged"" document viewable from your computer as the working copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call. Thank you. Sara Bolken X35150"

Normal,"Z/F !!!! wow. Who would have thunk it. Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as wide as last year. Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip. Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango. if it couldn't do it this year.... A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve told them to do last bid week. Obviously, more gas trying to come out than is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an Enron, to inject. Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling it out in G. When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f. Storage economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of winter. Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways. Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong. storage boys are withdrawing today and buying that. bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it going to zero? slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/22/2000 06:50:46 AM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc: Subject: re:mkts agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up buying em back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time is busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have the time. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways but one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called impact of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate at all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon. also will be curious how these ""loan deals"" by pipes work ouut. man these guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in the back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep that part of the curve very strong agree? be cool my man-talk later"

This still will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we deal with for obvious anonymity reasons.

Normal,"Frank: One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter. In such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $200. The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position currently. But in the winter that may change. Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on. Assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side. While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the payout probabilities may look like the following: 20% $ -.05 40% $ -.02 20% $ 0 19% $ .03 1% $ 1 Enron North America Corp.

If you do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should discuss, but they should not get in the way of release. If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august. any questions please feel free to call. -andy"

Normal,"Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree. I think consensus opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the winter. A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those projections seem to be closer to 2.7. With supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the equation. The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies will be stored rather than burned. Each AGA number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter. A low AGA number indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up. Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number may be a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand equilibrium. We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out. If we get two low injections, watch out. Enron North America Corp. From: Frank Hayden @ ENRON 07/12/2000 04:39 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Market Opinion about AGA's John, I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears. In the beginning of the season, AGA's were very important in framing the bull case. The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under stored. I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change that expectation. However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news. At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come from the physical market and weather. I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue. Thanks, Frank"

""Cooper, Sean"" <CooperS@EPEnergy.com> on 07/11/2000 08:03:41 PM To: cc: Subject: El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG - news </n/e/epg.html>) today announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69, an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million in the year-ago period. EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT. ``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to accelerate in the second quarter.'' For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515 million in the year-ago period. Second Quarter Business Segment Results The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed to the record second-quarter performance. The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and $19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day. The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million, nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March 2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d. Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3 TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement filed in March. The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's investment in the Philippines. Telecom Update ``We have made substantial progress in the development of our telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A. Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses, we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the telecommunications marketplace.'' Quarterly Dividend The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October 2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000. With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units: Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing, and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the completion of regulatory reviews.

Vince J Kaminski 06/01/2000 09:19 AM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jim Schwieger/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: VaR John, We have been working for the last few days on VaR related issues. The focus is on Jim Schwieger's storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26 where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process. It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative basis, jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position. This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a big jump in VaR. This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look at column D. The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors: a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the code to review it. b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can propose, is to develop for the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator allowing them to review the fwd vol curve before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol, it can be smoothed. Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings? Vince"

Normal,Please stop sending emails to jennifer_arnold to the following email address: jarnold@enron.com. You have the wrong person
Normal,"Jeff: Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit confused by the question. In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done. Market conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas. Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very favorable. I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level. John"
Normal,"Andy: The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options. Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes. If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade. If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money. Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market. Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the input into the option calculator is 3.75/4.75, 100 up. In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest, we must continue to support it. Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves. In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off. Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense. It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL. Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to call ENE to close the trade. If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times. Secondly, I would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction."
Normal,"Hey: Haven't had the best of months. Like you had some good positions but others wiped out everything. Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 months and then separates completely. The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are amazing. Something definitely out of whack. Hard to believe cash in Z will be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40. Spreads definitely implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter. Hell, already seeing it in the West. The system is just broken there. interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later. definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until latter part of the winter. the inelasticity of demand continues to be unbelievable. who would have thunk it. Gas can be 3 times what it was one year ago and not a significant loss of demand. market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point. continues to be a very trending market. most days finish on the intraday high or low. Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been significant. i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day. understand they are changing their view somewhat tomorrow. wait and see if it relieves some back pressure. very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 considering the scenario that's being painted. slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/21/2000 01:06:40 PM To: jarnold@enron.com cc: Subject: re:mkts johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled all the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was long mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure. but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to mark silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. any great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it. guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling dry up??"
Normal,"Andy: Just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed. First, what happens if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on EOL? Second, what strike are straddles traded at. Are they set at the nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the EOL quote?"

Normal,"Dutch: The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to two factors. First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics book due to the nature of the position. I am currently using the ltx to hold longer-term strategic positions. The large increase in position is a reflection of my view of the market. Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning. Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's position and a corresponding decrease occurred today. John"

Normal,"I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better replicate seasonal fundamentals. There are convincing arguments as to why the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time. However, in the previous methodology they blew out. For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 while Cal 10 was .256. I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of July and August over time. The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year. These premiums are as follows: Jan -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006 These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959, the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 4/5 spread was marked at .0475. In the old methodology Jan 2003 = 2.959 Jan 2004 = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005 = 2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044 In the new methodology Jan 2003 = 2.959 Jan 2004 = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005 = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028 The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month premium table The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I change them"

Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at the end. You should be ready to defend your answer. Only a number is allowed, not an algebraic equation. Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer), which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer. You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer. The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking. Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome. If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share. But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share. All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely. By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T. If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management. If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share. Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares. This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known. From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price. Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm. You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press. Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer. In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management. Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50. As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share. What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's stock? $______ per/share"

In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management. Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50. As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share.

You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer. The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking. Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome. If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share. But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share. All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely. By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T. If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management. If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share. Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares. This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known.

Universal was hesitant to comment on dollar amounts for the sponsorship but noted $250K would be the lowest amount for the JPI Virtual Institute. I wanted to consult your advice as to what tactics would be best at this point. Is Mark Palmer definitely the correct contact? Would you prefer to contact him on this front? Thanks. Colleen"

Normal,"Jennifer, I just spoke with Lee Jackson, Enron Plastics and Petrochemicals, in regard to Universal Studios. He did not feel Universal's plastic spend would be in the range their group would consider for a prospect. Lee said their main clients are chemical companies/producers. He mentioned a typical usage would be 1 Billion Lbs/yr in polymers and 5-10 MM Lbs/year in polymers large users. I also briefly mentioned EP&P possibly coming to do an overview training for us. I mentioned this to Sarah-Joy and she said she would schedule something through Alan Engberg beginning next year. Colleen"

We are hearing from quite a few people and the business is beginning to flow. On that subject Leonard did pass on to me that the signed contract is ""on the way"". The purpose of this e-mail is inquire about Enron's ability to provide/supply natural gas to our company. We consume quite a bit of natural gas relatively speaking in our aluminum furnace. I believe last year we spent about $500,000. As we both know the price of natural gas is rising. It never hurts to check and see if better deals are out there. If this is of any interest, please pass on to the appropriate person/group who would handle. The can contact me first and then I will turn over to our person here.

Normal,"Folks: John and Sireesha have just pushed to staging a bunch of enhancements / bug fixes / new features. Included in them are: 1. Configurable Questionnaire 2. Invitee Lists Part I (this does NOT include the upload of the contact lists) 3. User Statistics 4. Fix for the Issuing Entity 5. Auction security fix 6. Auction enhancements Part I 7. Rewrite of the view deal page impacting permission levels in EVERY domain 8. The Adapter for the User Registration piece (this should be seamless to the user, but be happy that this change ELIMINATES message brokers from this process) 9. Various bug fixes including those relating to view closing etc. The remaining auction enhancements are planned to be pushed sometime early next week. I would recommend everybody spend some time testing next week and reflect their comments / suggestions to John and I. The location of the test site is: You also need to establish new IDs and passwords (since your production IDs and Passwords will not work!). The admin ID and password (if you need to approve users and deals to test them are - ID: jspitz; Pwd: pass). We do PLAN on pushing all this stuff to PRODUCTION (barring any major bugs or mishaps) next FRIDAY - Dec 8th, 2000. Look forward to your comments. Thanks. SR:-)"

Normal,"Pushkar I quickly plotted the short and the long curves and the following come out in your face. 1. Is this policy easing going to be a one shot ( a la 98 ) followed by a quick pick up in economic activity, or is this going to be a more deeper situation. That is the big one. The curves vote for a small road-bump which will be rectified by a couple of eases over the next 6 months. Something the Fed can handle easily and quickly. This is most likely NOT going to happen - this is not a 98 and things are going to play out differently. There are a number of other possibilities. 2. The current slow-down is two pronged - capital spending slowdown from businesses ( especially on IT with the internet bust ) and the consumer spending slow-down , possibly because of the stock market wealth effect. Both of these have already hit the durable goods section. This reversal is 'Real' which takes longer to turn then the 'Financial crisis' hence there is good possibility we see a protraction of this weakness and even coupled with the fed eases this is going to take longer than six months to get better. 3. The new administration is going to take this as a good opportunity to force tax cuts. How does the Fed look at those ? Will the Fed balk and be less aggressive in the rate cuts expecting the tax cuts , will it ignore them. That makes the equation harder. It also to some extent argues that longer term rates go up if these tax cuts materialize. But on the shorter term who that effects Fed policy will have profound effect on the curve. All these favor a steeper curve. The 2-5 at -23 ( -6 on swap curve ), 2 -10 at -15 ( 18 on the swaps ) and 2-30 at 19 bps ( 37 bp) should all be steeper as market realizes the length of this ease cycle. If this cycle lasts an year ( the final and the last ease happens next Dec ) then the 2-10 should be 40 bp positive, as the market realizes that."

It hardly seems possible that we are another week on already such has been the pace of activity here . The ebb and flow in the Ali market both in the spreads and outright price have kept our valiant dealers on their toes as seemingly the whole market vies to avail itself of our pricing and liquidity services on-line ! . Daily volumes have continued to grow with over 800 separate transactions being seen today! . In fact volumes have risen by approximately 56% since December from a daily average of 357 to a daily average of 557 for January .At the same time the regular Non-EOL transaction count has decreased from about 1800 trades a day to 1586 trades since December. Your efforts at getting the registered customers who had not completed an on line trade are beginning to pay dividends finally - but the migration remains painfully slow . Keep plugging away The graph above illustrates the growth of our average daily online transaction volumes in relation to our regular transaction volume on a monthly basis from July of 99 to date . This week's daily transaction volume is another record and but for the blip on Monday which put down to the Mother's day in Africa holiday would have been sensational . We have asked for your response to several queries over the past three weeks and have received little or no reaction. Consequently we shall ask again. Currently at the top of the list: if each of you could create a list of Metals Conferences you believe would be beneficial for Enron metals to attend, speak at and/ or have metals or EnronOnline presence, it would be greatly appreciated. This is a multi faceted sales and marketing tool for your benefit . Aside from the overall goal of creating a unified metals marketing plan, we are also trying to prepare a budget to assure that proper attention and funds are given Enron metals Global exposure in 2001 . Therefore, if we do not receive your recommendations well in advance we will not be in a position to sponsor them . We have created a conference listing which will be circulated next week . Please add to it if we have missed any off . and mark onto our list those you think should have our attention . For those of you that missed it last week, we have attached another copy of the Account Application Form. The completion of this form for BOTH traditional and online customers will speed your client's access to trading with Enron Metals. The lack of contributions for this review from any of you is rather disappointing . We will continue to offer you items that you may find of use . However the purpose of this review is also to incorporate content from around the network of our global field offices. I know you are all very busy making money for the cause . This medium is a useful platform to get your message over . For those of you not on the circulation lists see the attached reports The Metals Crammer report The daily Options report Whilst not exactly a feature we thought it might be a useful exercise in client relationship damage limitation to explain what happens when a customer finds he cannot trade on line .This has begun to occur more regularly as our volumes and activity increase. Customers are allocated a credit line for EOL within the system based upon their agreements. This limit is set daily as a default against the clients name . basis the AS400 's net valuation of the client's position . The amount of available variation credit on the client's account on EOL is set as his limit f or the next days trading . If the client should trigger this limit during the next day's trading the system will reject the trade and lock out the customer . Not very user friendly as the customer is not told why . London credit (Hamish's team) get a red flag , as of course do the traders running the stack managers as they see the trade rejected. The problem now becomes one of frustration for the customer as the system will not allow him to liquidate his position either in part or whole .He will have to pick the phone to do this . Secondly the resetting of any limit in the system takes 48hrs . This is being worked on but we must remember that Metals are the only futures products on the system and the other OTC products on the system are dealt with differently . It also serves to highlight that clients with small credit lines in the 1 to 200,000 dollar range are not really suited to use EOL . Security such as g/tees and cash are taken into account but can be missed ,but forward profits are as it is net availability that is used on the AS400. This will all improve with the introduction of a new bridge between the Enron risk system and the AS400 in the very near future . In the meantime it will be up to you to keep the peace and explain to your clients . Get them to keep within their limits . Call them quickly when they get locked out. Remember, we are here to help your efforts and help create positive communication lines between our offices world-wide. So, send us your thoughts, questions, concerns, local area market news etc. We will look forward to hearing from you.

Normal,"Dear Mr. Arora: I wanted to thank you for taking the time to interview me this past Wednesday. I enjoyed meeting you and other representatives of the company and left our interview with a much greater understanding of what drives Enron and what the company seeks in its applicants. Your responses to my questions only confirmed my already high opinion of the company. As you know, I am a first year student at Owen concentrating in Finance and Electronic Commerce. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Bentley College in May of 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics & Finance, and I received an Honors Certificate in Economics from the University of Cambridge in August of 1995. After graduating from Bentley, I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as an analyst in its Financial Development Program. Most recently, I worked as an investments analyst for Thomson Financial, where I evaluated three major business development initiatives and five acquisition proposals totaling $44 million and worked with senior management on a takeover bid for one of Thomson's key competitors. I also performed strategic, market, and competitor analysis, and proposed ways of improving the organization's overall competitiveness. My professional experiences working in the High Technology and Financial Information Services industries have led to a complete redefinition of my career goals. I much prefer to be on the front lines of business, helping some of the world's most established organizations make decisions that will impact their financial future and competitive position in the market. I am anxious to begin my career with Enron and believe that a relationship with company would prove mutually beneficial. In closing, I would like to thank you again for interviewing me in Nashville. If you have any questions, please contact via e-mail at or at (615) 673-0329. Have a wonderful week! Best Regards, Ajay S. Jagsi"
Normal,"Here is my summary of our second round summer interviews. Top 3 candidates below. 1. Craig - Well rounded, Military background, excellent leadership experience (aircraft carrier pilot), did not have a finance background, but performed very well on Harry's analytical interview. Very personable, confident and sold himself well. I think he is very interested in Enron and would likely accept. 2. Victor - He was a strong candidate in my more subjective interview, but I didn't think he was quite as strong as Ajay. However he outperformed Ajay in the analytical interview. With that feedback from Harry I feel comfortable placing Victor ahead of Ajay. Also very interested in Enron. 3. Ajay - Very polished, presented/sold himself very well, Excellent understanding of Enron's business (did his homework), Relative to others based on my interview he ranked in the top 2, However did not perform as well as others in the top 4-5 in the analytical interview. For this reason I'd push him back to number three. Aside from these three there were two others that are worth discussing. Casey Jones Andrew Rosenberg We Understand these two may have outstanding offers from firms that they are very interested in. I would not consider either of these two ahead of Craig, but might place Casey ahead of Victor. However I think Casey is least likely to accept the offer. My suggestion would be to make offers to Craig & Victor, then consider a 3rd offer to Andrew, recognizing we would likely get a maximum of 2/3. Lee Jackson"

As I see it (refer to the attachment for more information), we might conduct, at best, five sealed-bids over the next three months. However, for each of the bids there may be more than 10 lots in each bid. Looking at the attached Notice of Solicitation as an example, we have 7 separate blocks for suppliers to bid having up-to 3 bid scenarios for each block for a total of 21 lots for this phase. The way I see it, future soliciations will follow a similar model. Having said this, an alternative to the current language would be to have 5-6 sealed bid opportunities with a 20-25 lot limit for each bid. Does this work for you or does this complicate the process for your group? Please advise.... Sam 5-6785 To: John Wack/HOU/EES@EES, Brad J Snyder/HOU/EES@EES, Samuel Harrell/HOU/EES@EES, Ross Mesquita/NA/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: Retail power RFQs on DealBench John We very much enjoyed meeting with you yesterday and discussing opportunities for EES and DealBench to work together. As we discussed, this email will serve as the framework for our pilot arrangement. As soon as we receive an email confirmation from you, your team will be able to add deals to the DealBench platform. 3-month access as a standard user (15 sealed-bid deals with up to 10 lots for each deal) . Months utilitzed do not need to be consecutive, but if a deal is up on DealBench in any day during a calendar month, that month will be inlcuded as part of the three month period. EES will pay DealBench a fee of $22,500, with $7,500 due immediately, $7,500 due February 28th, and $7,500 due March 31st. We would like to debit your RC directly to avoid billing overheads. EES will solely control and be responsible for all business transactions that it conducts on the DealBench platform. As such, DealBench assumes no liability for any EES business transactions conducted on DealBench. We believe you will realize significant value from DealBench and look forward to working with you. As you know, I am going to be happy when we do a Live Auction for you and save you some significant money. Please confirm, with your RC number that you are IN with this arrangement. We also would want to explore further the larger opportunity - I will try to allocate some-one to work on that one with you next week. Regards, Harry Arora"
Normal,"Louise - Below is the report on yesterday's DealBench issues. Please let me know if you would like further information. - Dan -----Original Message----- From: Elrod, Hal Sent: Friday, February 02, 2001 2:53 PM To: Bruce, Dan Cc: Hillier, Bob; Spitz, John Subject: DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution Importance: High Event Sequence ? Lot 1 of two Sabre auctions went through without issues ? Between Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval. About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page. Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal. The rest of the site was unaffected ? Within five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench. Solution Attempts: ? Restart the process that returns documents ? Move the documents off the deal Solution: ? Create a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents. ? The auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late. Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre. Cause ? Document management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values. This caused the View Deal page to appear ""hung"". The Document to be served was the ""deal agent logo"", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page. Contributing Factors ? The run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status ? The SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved. Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error. ? run.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days. Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source. Fixes ? An immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed ? Isolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios. ? Start logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process ? Make document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error ? Increase monitoring on new log files ? Initiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness"
Normal,"Kira- I got your name (and email address) from Chad Muir and was hoping to arrange a time to briefly (and informally) talk to you about Yahoo's B2B business strategy and whether you think there might be any opporunities to discuss some strategic relationship between Yahoo and Enron Net Works's DealBench subsidiary. Without getting into too many details, DealBench is an ASP addressing the needs of large, secure, sophisticated transaction participants. We are currently offering live online auctioning capabilities, online virtual datarooms and certain deal areas for the syndication of bank products and lease portfolios. We have completed transactions with nominal value of over $4 Billion since launching the site 4 months ago. My initial thought is that this could potentially fit in nicely with what I believe is Yahoo's need for recurring transaction-based revenues in certain B2B areas.

EDS is a totally different company, to which we have outsourced some stuff - so they have a number of employees on our premises ( on EDS contract). I personally do not work out at the bodyshop.

From: Jeff Bartlett 02/07/2001 03:16 PM To: Martin Bucknell/Enron@EnronXGate cc: (bcc: Harry Arora/HOU/ECT) Subject: Enron Flat Panel Procurement Just left you a voicemail, but thought I would follow up with an email summarizing my conversation earlier today with Philippe. Apparently for the new building, Enron will be purchasing 2000+ flat panels (I assume mostly PC monitors with potentially some Plasma TVs). Philippe would like to arrange 3 or 4 bidders to compete in a live, online DealBench auction. He mentioned that you would be in charge of contacting Compaq, NEC and the other suppliers of these displays and would be the primary Enron person involved in this procurement (I'm estimating it at a $2 to $4 million contract). I wanted to offer to have one of our Marketing professionals spend some time with you to walk through a sample auction to make sure you are comfortable with our platform and that we can meet all your live auctioning needs. Please give me a call at 3-5629 when you have a minute to discuss. If you want to arrange a demo, please contact Vanessa Carranza (3-5030). thanks, Jeff Jeffrey M.

You probably follow the DealBench activity but if you haven't watched specific details, we have observed the following activity level to date: India Deal Rooms A-G 9573 Deal and Document hits (since 27 Dec when stats became available) India Deal Room H 417 Deal and Document hits (since opening 1 Feb) China Deal Rooms A-B 500 Deal and Document hits (since opening 23 Feb) We consider the DealBench datarooms a great success. We appreciate the insights you shared with us when we were first designing the rooms, as well as, the support you provided with regard to our questions and problems thereafter. You were always knowledgeable, resourceful, responsive and courteous in all of our dealings. Thanks again, Miguel.

Normal,"Hi all, I just wanted to sum up our discussions from yesterday. Enron Global Assets is considering using DealBench for hosting virtual datarooms for the divestiture of 32 international assets. The projected total number of documents will be in the region of 3500. DealBench has offered to host these datarooms at a cost of $25k per dataroom. This is on the basis that you are hosting all 32 datarooms, as we have worked some steep discounts into the pricing. The term of the dataroom hosting services under this offer is for the year 2001. We have also offered to help with the transition of the data to the improved dataroom platform once that is in place sometime in Q2. You have mentioned that a few documents that you intend to upload are bigger than 8MB. We have discussed that we can lift the current file size ceiling to greater than 8MB. I just want to make you aware that for users of the platform with slower connections it will be extremely time consuming to download these files. Even under ideal circumstances it will take al least 5 minutes for a 15MB file to download. For users with slower connections it will potentially seem like the download has failed, even though the download is still in progress. This could result in a lot of calls to you and our help-desk. As I mentioned it might be of value to you to have professional assistance with the conversion of your paper documents to PDF. We are working together with a company in Houston that could help in the conversion process. From our experience file size and quality of scans are greatly improved by outsourcing this function. This is especially true if one is performing an OCR process on the TIFF files during conversion to PDF. In the light of the urgency of your projects it might be a good idea to start the dataroom preparation process as soon as possible. May I ask why you suggested to wait until March to get back in contact with us ? If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at 713-345-4147. We are very excited in helping you to deliver a world class solution. Thanks Tobias Munk"

If they like it, they can add themselves to the list at IN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE: 1. Would Government Oversight Be Charitable? 2. Drug Law Reform Up in Smoke 3. Battle Brings Out ""Pork-Barrel Politics"" 4. ""Why Freedom Matters More Than Ever"" -- Independent Policy Forum (12/4/01) WOULD GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT BE CHARITABLE? The terrorist attacks of September 11 took not only U.S. government officials by surprise, America's non-profit charities were totally unprepared to handle the huge outpouring of donations they have received in response to the attacks -- or to quickly dispense the donated funds to the victims' families. Of the $1.19 billion collected in the past two months, only $204 million has been distributed. This has provoked a tremendous outcry from donors and news commentators. If the charities don't act quickly to improve accountability and responsiveness to donor intent, the critics say, federal and state governments may be justified in stepping in. Members of Congress even proposed federal and state oversight of the charities during two hearings on Capitol Hill last week. Lack of accountability to donors is not a problem that plagues only charities (although in the present case, IRS laws may be largely to blame, since charities must take the time to ensure that aid recipients are legally qualified to receive charity). America's non-profit foundations have suffered from poor accountability since long before September 11, according to Randall G. Holcombe, research fellow at The Independent Institute, whose book WRITING OFF IDEAS examines the economic, cultural, and intellectual implications of tax-exempt organizations. Many of America's best-known non-profit foundations -- the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation, for example -- have gone far astray from the intent of their founders. These foundations' trustees and officers typically promote redistributionist government policies rather than the spirit of free-market entrepreneurship that Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie believed bestowed upon them their good fortune. Increased government scrutiny, both for charities and for foundations, is tempting. But, as Holcombe explains, it is a temptation we better not succumb to. If they are too inflexible (the charities) or too politically correct (the foundations) without government oversight, just think of how much more so they would be with government oversight, as special-interest groups try to pressure regulators to politicize charitable activities. ""We should hope for better performance from foundation trustees and management,"" writes Holcombe. ""[B]ut at this point additional government restrictions would be more likely to harm rather than help promote the public interest."" For a detailed summary of WRITING OFF IDEAS: Taxation, Foundations, and Philanthropy in America, by Randall G. Holcombe, see To order WRITING OFF IDEAS, see DRUG LAW REFORM UP IN SMOKE About 1.5 million Americans were arrested on drug charges last year -- an all-time high -- and eight out of ten of them were arrested for marijuana possession. If you think that this startling statistic is likely to drop in the near future, as law enforcement focuses on anti-terrorism, think again. President Bush's new drug czar, John Walters, who was confirmed 14-5 by the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, shows every sign of increasing enforcement of the nation's drug laws -- despite large segments of public opinion supporting drug decriminalization and a growing number of judges fed up with the government's counterproductive ""War on Drugs."" Even medical marijuana clubs that operate with voter approval can expect a crackdown under Walters. Despite the predicted escalation of the drug war domestically, the Walters regime may leave its largest imprint on foreign lands, where U.S. drug laws reverberate even louder but far out of earshot for most Americans. To get a take of Walters's drug-war diplomacy: When the Peruvian military shot down an airplane carrying two American missionaries (claiming they thought it was carrying drugs), Walters must have viewed the missionaries' deaths as unfortunate but unavoidable collateral damage. He did, after all, earlier praise the Peruvian military's practice -- in violation of international law -- of shooting down planes thought to be used by drug smugglers. So, unless Walters does something to force his resignation, such as have an affair with an intern, American citizens can look forward to increased drug incarcerations, drug turf battles, drug-related crime and a foreign policy tainted by a marriage of therapeutic rhetoric and preemptive militarism against possible drug smugglers. In other words, for the remainder of the Bush administration the prospects for positive drug-law reform have gone up in smoke.

Gray and Judge Vaughn Walker, at For information about the U.S. Drug War on foreign soil, see the transcript of ""The War on Drugs: Who Is Winning?

Drawing largely upon the work of Robert Higgs, senior fellow at The Independent Institute, Mr. Dougherty explains that both the U.S. Congress and the Department of Defense are culpable in wasting taxpayers' money on inappropriate weapons systems. ""Higgs,"" writes Dougherty, ""says pressure from defense contractors coupled with the typical bureaucracy of the Defense Department and politicians 'beholden to the complex' is turning the war between 'the U.S. and Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network into a more traditional exercise in pork-barrel politics.""

Americans hold that freedom makes economic progress and the good society possible -- yet many support curtailing freedom during national crises. Economist DAVID R. HENDERSON, however, holds that freedom is as important during wartime and recession as it is during peacetime and prosperity. Based on his insightful and inspiring new book, THE JOY OF FREEDOM, Dr. Henderson will demonstrate the power of individual choice and free markets to improve education, health, the environment, community, culture, and much more. Not only is the intellectual battle for freedom exciting and just, according to Dr. Henderson, it is crucial for ensuring lasting peace, security and harmony. SPEAKER: -- DAVID R.

Normal,"THE LIGHTHOUSE ""Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy..."" Vol. 3, Issue 45 November 19, 2001 Welcome to The Lighthouse, the e-mail newsletter of The Independent Institute, the non-politicized, public policy research organization <http://www.independent.org>.

If they like it, they can add themselves to the list at IN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE: 1. Revised Draft No Better Than Original 2. The Second Amendment, the Courts and the Professoriate 3. Why ""Smart Growth"" Isn't REVISED DRAFT NO BETTER THAN ORIGINAL Although President Bush said he would resist efforts to reinstate conscription, its growing popularity among the pundit class is likely to make the draft an important topic in upcoming public debate. But don't expect this discussion to exactly parallel the debate that led to its termination in 1973. Today's ""war against terrorism"" is creating a dynamic that is redrawing the domestic political landscape, creating new coalitions potentially strong enough to have the draft reinstated. Most of the nation's political groups have factions that would like to see some type of involuntary servitude, be they anti-capitalist ""progressives"" who want to see the best of the nation's youth derailed from the career fast track, nationalistic ""conservatives"" who want to mandate ""patriotism"" and reinvigorate a strong sense of nation-consciousness, or Demopublican ""moderates,"" such as Secretary of State Colin Powell, who want youth to make ""voluntarism"" a high priority. But just as the war on terrorism is ""like no other war"" (Bush), so the next draft is not your father's draft. Charles Moskos and Paul Glastris, writing in the WASHINGTON POST, make clear that the new draft will be packaged not as a cheap, quick way to enlarge the military, but as a new form of government-assisted public expression of the conscripts' values, i.e., a form of choice! Draftees will thus have their pick among, for example, the armed services, homeland defense jobs, such as airport security, and civilian national-service programs, such as AmeriCorps. As Independent Institute senior fellow Robert Higgs says, ""some choice."" ""Moskos and Glastris's proposal raises several important questions,"" writes Higgs, ""none of which they see fit to consider. Perhaps in a follow-up article they will tell us: Whatever happened to the idea that every person, even a young man, has inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? Whatever happened to the idea that a just government is instituted to secure these rights, not to crush them underfoot upon the earliest pretext? What exactly do we gain if we can defend ourselves only by destroying the very heart and soul of what it is about this country that deserves defending?"" See ""Will the Draft Rise from the Dead?"" by Robert Higgs (LewRockwell.com, 11/15/01), at For detailed background on the growth of government and the draft, see ""War and Leviathan in Twentieth-Century America: Conscription as the Keystone,"" by Robert Higgs, at THE SECOND AMENDMENT, THE COURTS AND THE PROFESSORIATE The most important firearm case in years, United States v. Emerson, was a solid victory for the rights of gun owners. One of the strengths of the decision, rendered earlier this year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, was its citation of the vast body of scholarship that supports the individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment, as well as numerous statements made by America's founders showing that ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms"" was intended to protect an individual right. This alone will help ensure that the correct interpretation of the Second Amendment will spread, as jurists, attorneys, and law students study the decision's citations for years to come. Critics of the individual-rights interpretation, however, have not relented. But neither has Independent Institute research fellow and Second Amendment attorney Stephen Halbrook, author of the classic book, THAT EVERY MAN BE ARMED: The Evolution of a Constitutional Right, as he made clear in two recent replies to prominent law school professors. According to Prof. Michael Dorf of Columbia University Law School, despite the Emerson decision the individual-rights interpretation of the Second Amendment is as much a ""fraud on the American public"" as when ex-Chief Justice Warren Burger passed that judgement nearly twelve years ago. Halbrook, however, explains that the Emerson ""is the first ever federal appellate opinion to contribute an adequate textual analysis of the Second Amendment."" Thus, the decision observed that ""throughout the Constitution, the 'people' have 'rights' and 'powers,' but federal and state governments only have 'powers' or 'authority,' never 'rights.'"" Further, says Dorf, the Second Amendment protects only an armed militia, as indicated by the preamble, ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state...."" Responds Halbrook: ""But as Emerson explains, this preamble announces the objective of securing a free state by a militia, which in turn is encouraged by and drawn from the people who exercise the right to keep and bear arms."" Similarly, Halbrook easily dispatches numerous other distortions by Dorf. Unlike Dorf, constitutional scholars Amar Akhil (Yale) and Vikram Amar (UC Hastings) have a generally correct assessment about the Emerson decision but are guilty of committing a few historical oversights. For example, the Amars state that ""the Emerson court found only one clear nonmilitary use of the phrase before 1798,"" but they overlook numerous statements by Jefferson, Madison and Adams explicitly advocating the protection of a right to keep and bear firearms for self-defense. See: ""Reports of the Death of the Second Amendment Have Been Greatly Exaggerated: The Emerson Decision,"" by Stephen P. Halbrook, at ""Emerson's Second Amendment,"" Stephen P. Halbrook, at For a summary of the new edition of Stephen P. Halbrook's classic, THAT EVERY MAN BE ARMED: The Evolution of a Constitutional Right, see WHY ""SMART GROWTH"" ISN'T High-density living, characterized by ""transit villages"" close to public transportation, will reduce air pollution, save commuters from the aggravation of traffic congestion and contribute to an improved quality of life in our communities, according to proponents of the faddish ""smart growth"" movement. Are these claims true? Would we be better off moving back to the cities and junking our cars? According to urban economists Daniel Klein and Randal O'Toole -- who discussed these questions in our Oct. 3rd Independent Policy Forum, ""Smarter Urban Growth: Markets or Bureaucracy?"" -- the ""smart growth"" movement is ""smart"" in name only, since many of its policies work against their intended goals. Smart growth advocates uphold public rail systems in European cities as models but ignore the fact that with few exceptions American cities lack the population density needed to make rail systems cost-effective. And with good reason: automobiles are more flexible, faster, affordable, safe and comfortable. And as cars have improved in quality, the U.S. urban public transit market has been shrinking. Hence, cities that build rail systems display little economic sense but plenty of what Klein called ""infrastructure envy."" O'Toole pointed out that the costs of smart growth are significantly larger than its proponents recognize. Drawing largely upon the experience of Portland, Oregon, O'Toole showed how smart-growth policies have led to escalating housing prices, tied up the 98% of the state that remains rural open space, and contributed to bad traffic congestion and air pollution.

Normal,"Vote of confidence on Schr?der's government today The vote of confidence in the German lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, is scheduled to take place at 11.00 GMT today, the result should be out 15 to 20 minutes after that. In test votes in the government coalition's factions this morning, only four Greens voted against the government. As there was one defection from the SPD faction yesterday, but all other SPD MPs voted for the government, Chancellor Schr?der looks set to win the vote of confidence, but it is a very tight race. Schr?der needs 334 yes-votes of the 666 total votes in the Bundestag and is likely to get 336 according the tests this morning. If he loses, Schr?der has three options: 1) Form a coalition with the liberal FDP until the federal election in the autumn of next year, 2) remain in the seat with a minority government and hope on support from other parties for the remaining issues of the term, 3) ask the President of the Federal Republic to dissolve Parliament and call new elections. We feel that options 3) is the most likely of these options, 1) has a decent probability as well but 3) is unlikely. It is possible that the market appreciates the outlook for a more conservative government and plays ideas like earlier tax cuts and/or cancellation of the scheduled hike in energy taxes if Schr?der fails. However, we believe that there will be little change in politics, especially in economic issues, as the budget is very tight. So hopes for more fiscal stimulus should be short-lived if they occur at all. There is in any case going to be more uncertainty if Schr?der fails which is never good news, but which should also have only a limited impact on financial markets.

Normal,"*** PDF version incl. charts is attached *** German ifo business sentiment fails to recover Oct 2001 Actual UBSW fc Market Previous Headline index (1995=100) 84.7 86.0 85.0 85.0 Balance - total -26.2 -23.6 -18.7 -25.6 Balance - current conditions -27.0 -26.4 na -27.7 Balance - expectations -25.4 -20.7 na -23.5 n In contrast to our forecast, the ifo index of west German business confidence failed to recover from the shock level of September. The drop in the headline index of 0.3 points is not particularly worrisome. However, the further decline in business expectations suggests that production, investment and most likely employment plans have been slashed further at the beginning of Q4. n Although we continue to look for a stabilisation of the ifo index soon , today?s data suggest that GDP will contract in the current quarter, consistent with our forecast. They also cast doubts over the expected output recovery in the early months of 2002. The bad news in today?s ifo data is not the slight decline in the headline index. This alone would only have underpinned forecasts of industrial production and GDP decline in Q4 which is a consensus view anyway. The really bad news is the further fall in business expectations from what was considered to be an exaggeratedly weak post-attack shock level. It suggests that German companies are still far from concluding the ongoing process of adjustments in output, investment ad employment. Therefore, today?s further ifo decline not only underpins forecasts of two consecutive GDP declines in German in Q3 and Q4, but also challenges the widely held expectation of a recovery in industrial output early next year. Chart 1 suggests that the latest ifo pattern has increased the risk of a double dip in German production growth. Despite the bad news, however, we continue to believe that the ECB will not cut rates further this year, but prefer to wait until early 2002 with the next reduction in the refinance rate.

Normal,"*** PDF version is attached *** Germany falls into recession Q3 2001 Actual UBSW fc Market Previous % qoq, adjusted -0.1 -0.1 -0.1 -0.0 % yoy, adjusted 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.6 % yoy, unadjusted 0.3 0.4 n/a 0.6 German GDP contracted for the second consecutive quarter and in contrast to Q2, this time, the decline did not get lost in the rounding of the quarterly growth rate. Hence, it is now indisputable that Germany is in recession. Due to the bleak outlook for Q4, it is also undisputed that it will fall even deeper into recession. All components of final domestic demand dropped in Q3. Inventories experienced the greatest decline in the history of the pan-German national accounts data. Another surprise came in the form of the greatest trade surplus ever recorded. This pattern is unsustainable and will be reversed in the quarters ahead. We forecast a 0.5% contraction in German GDP in the current quarter. However, there are also some bright spots for 2002, most importantly the outlook for an end of the inventory correction and lower inflation which will relive private households? disposable income. Therefore, we stick to our GDP forecast of 0.6% this year and 0.9% in 2002 on average. Most components of domestic demand were in line with expectations in the third quarter. Private consumption dropped 0.2% as disposable income fell marginally and households lifted their savings to a rate of 10.5% from 10.2% in Q2. Equipment investment fell by 1.8% qoq after downwards-revised 3.2% contraction in the second quarter. As a slight surprise, construction investment was flat in Q3 rather than falling further. This was the first quarter since Q3 1999 in which demand in the sector did not decline. The greatest surprise within domestic demand was a record EUR5.4bn fall in inventories which resulted in a negative contribution of 1.1%pts to annual GDP growth, the worst figure since 1993 Q1. However, it has to be seen against the background of a 1.1% qoq rise in exports and a 2.2% fall in imports both of which seem to at least partly reflect logistical problems after 11 September. As far as the outlook is concerned, there is good and bad news, with the bad news more associated to the near term and the good news to the more distant future. The fall in the ifo index of business confidence suggests that equipment investment is likely to continue to fall in Q4 and in the first half of next year. We also believe that private households will remain cautious in the Christmas season and increase savings, also taking the introduction of new private pension schemes next year into account. This would depress GDP growth in Q4 and the early parts of 2002. We also expect both the negative inventory and the positive net export contribution to growth to be reversed, but this should have no significant net effect. On the positive side, the ongoing decline in energy prices, which is likely to be accompanied by lower core inflation next year, is expected to boost real disposable income next year. In addition, at some stage, precautionary saving is likely to be reduced both of which argues for a consumption recovery, even in the absence of employment growth. The substantial inventory contraction this year, which is expected to depress average 2001 GDP growth by 0.7%pts, would argue for a partial rebuilding in 2002, especially in the second half of the year which is likely to lift GDP growth then as well. All in all, the outlook is therefore for more and accelerating German GDP weakness around the turn of the year, but for recovery in the course of 2002 which is also expected to be supported by recovering demand from the US and other regions of the world which are experiencing greater policy stimulus than Germany and the euro area. Our average GDP forecast of 0.6% growth this year and 0.9% in 2002 remains in place. Our forecast for exit growth rates (GDP growth yoy in the fourth quarter) are ?0.3% for 2001 and 2.4% for 2002 which highlights the momentum of the recovery implied by these average growth rates.

Normal,"COMMENTS EUR SWAPS Flow of the day was large and consistent paying of 2s and 3s as they were paid in blocks of 250-500mm throughout the course of the session. This had the effect of flattening 2/10s by an impressive 8bps and of widening swap spreads by about 0.75bps in that part of the curve while spreads elsewhere closed the day pretty much unchanged. Further out the curve, we saw strong interest in the 5/10 spread though it's unclear if this was new risk or profit taking from the dealer community. With regard to spreads, I'm wondering if it makes sense to put on a swap spread widener here with a very short term view. Swap spreads blew out in the US yday as the market got the sense that most of the new issuance was out of the way and given how well EUR spreads held in despite yday's Singtel, ATT, and EIB pricing, perhaps EUR spreads are due for a small correction. Still like the narrower longer term, just thinking on a very short term basis. WHY THE FED WILL BE SLOW TO TIGHTEN In our view the econ recovery is not likely to be very powerful. There are large imbalances in the household and corporate sectors and the sources of stimulus (mortgage financing, etc) are likely to be much less than previously expected. Additionally, while it is true the nominal rates have fallen sharply, the decline in real rates is roughly half of the decline in nominals. On the inflation front, we believe inflation is likely to decline further as a consequence of both excess capacity and higher unemployment. With most major indices at 2.5% or lower, the Fed can be much more patient than normal when they consider whether or not they need to take back some of the 450bps of easing. Overall, we believe the Fed will want the econ to grow at an above trend rate in order to psh it back to full employment but against this we have a market that is now incorporating a signif amount of tightening over the next near (Dec Euro$ up 90bps in the last week). Even building in a risk premium of 10bps per contract, a 25bp sprd between 3m libor and fed funds, and 15bps of year end pressure, this still implies about 100bps of tightening by 2003. While not impossible, it neither reflects the Fed's thinking nor appears anywhere close to the center of our probability distrubtion. USD SWAPS/VOL Another 3 standard deviation event yday, with the sell-off in treasuries snowballing as negatively convex portfolios capitulated into selling by paying fixed at higher rates. The cork was finally removed from the pressurized bottle in spreads - with most corporate deals out of the way - and took their natural course by widening by 5bps. We saw heavy flows, with paying across all sectors, save the very long end. Vols were up on the day. Gamma shot up 0.5bps/day, which is a pretty large move; longer expiries were up about 0.2bps/day, which is in line with the market price of skew. Flows were not as heavy as one might have expected; at least for the time being. The market is clearly saying that this is the turn in the economy, and that we're already heading for a sharp recovery, with aggressive Fed tightening action over 2002. This seems to be somewhat premature. With no inflation in sight, and still big signs of weakness in the economy, it is unlikely that the Fed will reverse its course this fast. Whilst this sell-off might not be over in the near term, (expect high volatility), we remain constructive on the outlook for rates in the medium term. IPOs & CORPORATE ISSUANCE Both the coporate bond market and the equity IPO market seem to be recovering a bit here. The avg spread tightening on the 3 Sing Tel and 4-fixed rate ATT tranches is 19bps between where the deal was priced yday and where it opened this morning. On the equity side, not only are our sec lending people telling us that short interest is decreasing (ie more pple covering shorts), but IPO calendar is also firming up. The US market had its busiest week of the year with 5 IPOS & 15 secondary offerings and can look forward to the $3bln Prudential next month while Europe pitched in with a $3bln convert deal for Swiss Re and expects some $9bln in new issuance by the end of the year. While it's unclear how much underwater portfolios will look to take on new posns going into year end and while this flood of issuance may simply be due issuers looking to tie up loose ends before year end, it does appear the global investor base is becoming a bit more receptive to new deals.

Normal,"I know that this is a difficult time for all of us. With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year. To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed. Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season. Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances. After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8. Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event. I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more. We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season. Ken Lay"

Normal,"As mentioned earlier, we have the opportunity to sell a 76MW, 7x24, fixed for floating financial swap to these guys for 5 years beginning 1/1/02. They want offers from both the PJM-East and PJM-West Hubs. In an effort to lower the fixed price, they are willing to sell let us curtail during Monday-Friday for the term of the deal on an hour-ahead basis. There can be a variety of call option structures, depending upon which gives them the largest premium (options being number of hours which we can curtail each day). Nick has begun working on valuing an at the money, 5x8 call (effectively an 8-hour curtailment), with hour-ahead notice. Rob Benson is pricing the swap. As soon as we get the swap price (and the resulting strike price for the call), Nick can firm up his initial valuation and we can discuss with you.

Normal,"Over the past few weeks we have struggled to find an appropriate parallel to the economic situation in the aftermath of September 11. In a recent paper we argued that the appropriate parallel for the post 9/11 was the Gulf War. In both cases the incident punctuated what we already knew: that the economy was in recession. We also pointed out some interesting similarities. In both cases, Alan Greenspan was chairman of the Fed and George Bush was president. However, there are some major differences this time. The George Bush in the White House now is proposing to lower tax rates. For that reason we believe that the recovery is going to be stronger than that of the previous recession.

Normal,"As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history. We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition. It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs. ? ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program. The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders. Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored. Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service. Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ? Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely. As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations. Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored. We regret that we have had to make these changes. We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period."

Other topics of discussion include: a way to tap your life insurance benefit if you're terminally ill, and how to combine your retirement accounts the right way. Charles Payne, principal analyst of Wall Street Strategies, explains why he remains upbeat on stocks despite the lack of a potent Santa Claus rally, and lifts his glass to the prospect of seeing Osama bin Laden's head on a platter.

INVESTMENT IDEAS Watch out for Web services Venture capitalists count the many ways of metaware By Carla Drysdale, columnist As technology and the information age continues to both enrich and complicate our lives, chief information officers are becoming more excited about an emerging field that promises to smooth out some of the operational kinks. Web services, or what is sometimes called ""metaware,"" may well describe the offering of many companies that attract venture financing next year. The next stage in the evolution of software, the solution would allow companies to transfer business functions to the Internet, and off proprietary networks and hardware systems. The technology would allow a company to send updates to software across different operating systems, devices and computers. Instead of updating all servers and computers one by one, they could do it once, sending it across an entire system. Click here to read more. 2. INVESTMENT IDEAS Heads up! While a Santa Claus rally did not materialize, it's worth paying attention as we head into a brave new year By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies The market, especially technology stocks, had been priced for perfection, but the utopian world that investors hoped for is still a work in progress. That point was driven home via bad news from Juniper (JNPR), Solectron (SLR) and Jabil (JBL), to go along with a series of disappointments during the previous week. Economic data that came down the pike during the week also painted a picture of slow recovery at best. Yet there are reasons for investors to feel optimistic while knocking back the eggnog (no doubt spiked a little heavier than usual) this Christmas Day. Last week the initial jobless claims came in lower than the previous week, stretching this trend to three weeks. Now, the four-week average is 438,000, not below the pivotal 400,000 but significantly lower than the 508,000 posted just a few weeks ago.

Thi swas 0.2%pts lower than expected. The outcome is a consequence of sharply falling energy and food prices. Core inflation will have remained unchanged. Pipeline inflation indicators released yesterday underpinned the favourable trend. n In the absence of further oil price decline, inflation is likely to rise slightly next month. Further significant declines are expected from February 2002, taking German inflation below 1% by the middle of the year. If this is only partly mirrored in other euro area economies, the ECB will have leeway to cut rates further next year as we expect. Food and energy prices were the main forces behind the inflation decline in November. From the state data, we estimate that food price inflation will have fallen from 6.6% to about 5.5% yoy. Household energy prices dropped by about 1.6% mom reflecting a substantial heating oil price decline and petrol prices fell between 0.8% and 3.4% in the reporting states. Core inflation will barely have changed from last month?s 1.8%. The favourable German inflation picture was preceded by much larger than expected declines in October produce r and import prices reported yesterday. Altogether, the data of the last two days underpin our forecast that both headline and core inflation will fall substantially next year. Hence, our forecast of further ECB easing in 2002 Q1 remains firmly in place.

Normal,"French GDP, the last good news before the fall? GDP (Q3) Actual: +0.5%qoq, +2.0%yoy UBS Warburg: +0.3%qoq, +1.8%yoy Consensus: +0.3%qoq, +1.8%yoy Previous: +0.2%qoq, +2.2%yoy French GDP is clearly a good surprise. However it owes much to one off effects from tax cuts which boosted consumption. The other elements of the GDP have remained quite weak. If consumption falters next quarter (as we expect) GDP growth could end up being much lower. Hence we remain very cautious on the medium term. French GDP accelerated in Q3 at +0.5% qoq. Part of this good news is however due to the fact that Q2 was revised down (+0.2%qoq instead of +0.3%). * Household consumption is the reason for the good number, it was up 1.2% qoq (after +0.3% in Q2) and contributed to 0.7% to GDP growth. This good performance is essentially the result of one off tax cuts, notably the employment premium paid at the beginning of September. These effects should vanish away in Q4 and the preliminary information available for October retail sales indeed support this view. * Other elements of final domestic demand are much more modest. Investment remained virtually flat with a mere +0.1% qoq increase. We expected a contraction hence the resilience of investment is a small positive for us. However, investment should remain in the doldrums as long as industrialists' prospects are as low as currently. * Stocks contributed negatively (-0.4% qoq) to growth. This is not really a surprise given the surge in consumption. But this is a positive element for next quarter, stocks are likely to be back up. * Both exports and imports plummeted again reflecting the deterioration of international trade. Exports were down 1.5% qoq (like in Q2) while imports fell 1.5% qoq as well (after -1.0% in Q2). Overall, the contribution from net trade was thus flat, in line with our expectations. But this could go into negative territory as foreign demand will continue to weaken.

Normal,"* After recording 1.9% GDP growth during 1H2001, the Thai economy is heading into a recession despite 1.9%-point of GDP of government stimulus measures slated for FY2001 and FY2002 in each fiscal year. * The growth slowdown will lead to a further deepening of Thailand's negative output gap. As domestic and corporate debt levels have not been whittled down to any great extent since the Asian crisis, risks remain for the economy to suffer from a deflationary debt overhang. Rising debt levels, thereby, provide less leeway for the government to provide further stimulus in the years ahead. * Inadequate NPL restructuring and falling capacity utilisation rates also point to a poor reallocation of production capacity since the Asian crisis and low future recovery values on NPLs. This should keep bank profitability and capital bases under pressure besides adding to government debt-GDP ratio's medium term. * Although the new TAMC will speed up the restructuring of NPLs, the TAMC will not spur any major pick-up in bank lending or reduction in private bank NPLs if there is a continued absence of creditor-friendly bankruptcy and collateral foreclosure laws. Moreover, given the high levels of (quasi-) NPLs among private banks, TAMC may have to provide additional public subsidies to the private banks with a further nationalisation of private sector debt a worst case outcome. * Against this backdrop, we believe that Thailand should move towards a neutral fiscal/looser monetary policy mix with the 14-day repo rate cut by 100bp to zero in real terms. * Thailand's balance of payments would also benefit from a weaker THB as this would help stem the decline in its current account surplus, while attracting even more FDI inflows. In this respect, a floating exchange rate would prevent a too large erosion of FX reserves due to continued heavy foreign debt repayments. * The public sector, for instance, is set to repay USD10.2bn in IMF loans over the next two years. Given current tight spread levels, we believe that the new supply will lead to a repricing of the sovereign curve. A tighter fiscal policy stance will, on the other hand, lead to a flattening of the local yield curve, which provides one of the most attractive roll-down opportunities within the Asian region."

By Carla Drysdale As the country struggles to its feet after the crash of the new economy, exacerbated by the Sept. 11th attacks on the WTC, angel investors have been doing their part to help by continuing to provide seed money to startups. Angels, first earned this moniker during depression-era New York by bailing out ailing Broadway theatre companies. Since then, angel investments, along with those of venture capitalists, have expanded from Broadway to the Internet and beyond. Now, because traditional VCs are slowing the pace of investments, angels have new opportunities to swoop down to fill in the seed-stage gap.

Normal,"Subject: TYZ/TYH ROLL SHOULD NARROW/Roll longs now Date sent: Mon, 26 Nov 2001 15:24:12 +0000 Recommendation: Roll long TYZs now at 39/32 or roll short TYZ later in week 2 to 3/32 lower. Rationale: The TYZ/TYH roll will be impacted by a number of factors. Most important, we believe, will be changes in the contract's cheapest-to-deliver caused by market movements. Changes in CTD will change the amount of net positive carry that is the primary determinant of the TYZ/TYH roll's value. For example, The TYZ/TYH roll priced using the 6.5% 2/10 has 35.75/32 of net carry, while the roll priced with the 4.7% 11/08 has only 28.5/32 of net carry. |TYZ/TYH |TYZ est.|Net |Est. | |Cheapest- |CTD |positive|TYH/TYZ | |to-Deliver |switch |carry |roll | | |price |(32) |(32) | |4.7 11/08 | 111-00| 23.50| 33.0| |5.5 5/09 | 109-00| 28.50| 36.0| |6.0 8/09 | 106-16| 32.25| 37.5| |6.5 2/10 | current| 35.75| 39.0| |5.7 8/10 | 103-16| 30.50| 37.5| Assumes term repo for TYZ at 1.9% and 1.8% for TYH. Switch prices are estimates and can vary greatly due to changes in CTD yield spreads. TYZ/TYH Option Value In addition to changes in net carry, the spread will also be impacted by changes in the contracts' net option value. Implied volatility on TYH options rose 150 basis points during the previous week. The net option value, (TYZ option value-TYH option value) is6.5/32. A 100 bps change in TYH options' implied volatility should impact TYZ/TYH roll by roughly 1.2/32 TYZ/TYH 60-day Spread History Current 39/32 Average 33/32 High 39/32 Low 33+/32 Good Luck and Take Care Jon and Warren at the CBOT 312-987-5970 or 800-547-3587, 312-347-5061 This report has been prepared for informational purposes only.

Normal,"To all G7 clients, We are pleased to see that SOMEONE is reading our survey...hope you are too. Best regards, Jane Hartley CEO G7 Group, Inc. CONSUMERS TOO AFRAID TO SPEND By JOHN CRUDELE ------ November 13, 2001 -- CONSUMERS are talking tough and optimistic, but acting weak and glum. That's the big problem in the American economy right now. And things like yesterday's plane crash - whether caused by terrorism or not - are likely to aggravate that situation. The dual personality being exhibited by Americans is bothering the Federal Reserve, whose interest-rate cuts won't be nearly as effective if consumers are too scared to borrow money. I spoke with a source of mine who is familiar with the Fed's thinking and he tells me that monetary authorities are concerned, as well as perplexed, by consumers' unwillingness to part with a dollar even as they are feigning confidence. In particular, Alan Greenspan's outfit is troubled by a research report dated Oct. 18 that was conducted by an independent Washington outfit called G7 Group. The group had the Princeton Survey Research Associates interview 1,045 adults between Oct. 8 and 10. This poll was given to me by someone close to the Fed. The survey found that post-Sept. 11, Americans were putting on a good front. For instance, 66 percent of the people polled said that now is a ""good time"" to purchase a car or a house, but 63 percent said they ""did not feel like"" making a major purchase. Only 41 percent of the respondents felt like shopping for clothes and 75 percent felt comfortable buying only necessities like groceries. Consumer confidence has been dropping since before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But the current level of confidence could be greatly overstated because it measures what people are saying and not what they are doing. And the Princeton Survey shows that consumers are talking a good game but buckling when it comes to taking an economic turn at the plate. Not surprisingly, job security is the chief concern, although Americans refuse to admit it. Even though the U.S. lost 415,000 jobs last month and our unemployment rate jumped sharply to 5.4 percent, more than 70 percent of those surveyed said they felt the same or more optimistic than they did a few months ago. The Fed cut interest rates for the tenth time last week. Another rate cut is expected in December. The Fed made an even bolder move two weeks ago when it announced that it was going to stop selling 30-year government bonds. The result was that interest rates on long bonds came down sharply, putting them more in proportion with recent rate reductions. As I've said in previous columns, the long bond has been a nuisance for the Central Bank because it hasn't declined as much as expected. This has caused things like mortgage rates to remain higher than they could have been. The G7/Princeton survey explains to the Fed why its interest rate strategy hasn't been working. But it doesn't necessarily explain why - as the surveyors concluded - ""the Sept. 11 attacks opened a chasm between what Americans are thinking rationally about the economy and what Americans are feeling as they now confront economic decisions."" What will yesterday's incident do to confidence? That's anyone's guess. But unless the government quickly explains what happened to the public - and that's unlikely in a crash investigation like this - then Americans are likely to keep up their tough facade while being weak in the knees. Over the last decade America's mood has depended a lot on how Wall Street was feeling. The stock market dipped sharply right after yesterday's plane crash, but snapped back. The Federal Reserve figures, I'm told, that if interest rates stay down and the stock market remains stable, then Americans will eventually regain their confidence. Let's hope so. But if you are investing in a stock market that is this overpriced, you should understand that the risks are great. And they are getting greater. -John Crudele, NY Post, November 13,2001"
Normal,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview = of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call. We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter= ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit= y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe= ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses. It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot = of significant events that led to our current situation: -- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co= re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu= rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve= r imagined when we made these investments; -- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa= ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex= tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet; -- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in= vestor confidence, which has been very damaging; -- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under= stand financial and operating disclosures; and -- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d= iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo= usly reported earnings. We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three= areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review. Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear= nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th= ese include: -- Natural gas pipeline businesses; -- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe; -- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and -- Coal businesses in North America and Europe. The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou= r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti= me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering= these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002= . I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple = of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity = concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i= mprovement in our counterparty relationships. Non-Core Businesses Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d= ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the= return from them has been dismal. We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect = that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash= that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre= ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th= ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN= G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga= s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale= is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals. Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga= s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev= eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete= rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff= icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation. Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make= reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b= ecomes available. Credit Rating/10-Q Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that = our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba= lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr= edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows: -- Moody's at Baa3 ""Under Review for Further Downgrade"" -- Fitch at BBB- ""Evolving Status"" -- S&P at BBB- ""CreditWatch Negative"" We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin= and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1= 0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. = 19. We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we= ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference = call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next = few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve= stors under ""SEC Filings."" =20 =20 In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a = joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio= n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro= xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes= available, because it will contain important information.

By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies The telecommunications sector's equipment makers has been at the root of all the heartache felt by investors over the last two-years; it represents the bloated inventories and even more bloated valuations; investors thought they were gliding to a land of early retirements, vacation homes and endless toys when the balloon began to lose air (it didn't pop, but behaved more like a hot air balloon that descended faster and faster as it approached a hard landing). Like visionaries in love with a concept, investors are still in love with the telecommunications space and will continue to bet on the balloon recovering altitude and taking flight once more. I agree that some of these balloons will indeed become airborne, but getting them off the ground will be trickier than advertised. Click here to read more: 2. Upwards revisions: Better and better Rather than taking the sector as a whole, investors should consider individual opportunities. By Dave Sterman Recessions are something of a double-edged sword for investors. On the one hand, sales growth slows for many of their portfolio companies, taking share prices on a southbound trajectory. But for those with cash to spare, they have a rare chance to buy quality companies at fire sale prices. With that in mind, we went screening for long-term winners in the telecom sector that are now quite cheap. We specifically sought out stocks that are now fairly inexpensive when compared to their historical earnings growth rate. As the accompanying table shows, these stocks have a PEG (price/earnings ratio in relation to earnings growth) of below 0.7. And to make sure that analyst sentiment corroborates the attractive valuation, we insisted these stocks be supported by at least three ""strong buy"" ratings, and that analysts have raised their ratings over the last three months.

By Dave Sterman Toss another sector into the telecom rubble. Shares of cell tower operators are hitting new lows and now sell for just a small fraction of their peaks. Curiously, on many levels, the sector is fairly healthy; revenues are strong, and major players have been able to avoid the cutthroat price wars that have characterized the rest of the telecom industry. That apparent disconnect could spell an opportunity for investors with a strong stomach for a long and bumpy ride. These firms are saddled with eye-popping levels of debt, but should soon benefit from a much more rational operating landscape. Weaker players are on the ropes, and their eventual demise will enable the stronger players to get back on their feet as they garner a bigger slice of the pie. Click here to read more: 4. International wires: From Russia with love A troika of telecom stocks that are well-positioned for current trends and gaining analyst esteem. BYLINE: Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist When shares of Russian-based telecom companies start earning a measure of analyst esteem, savvy investors owe it to themselves to take a further look. To be sure, these three Russian telcos haven't yet attained analysts' highest rating, but quite surprisingly--and seemingly out of nowhere--each has an average rating better than a neutral 3, and one of them has moved up to an average rating of 2 (""buy"").

Changing directions: Mobile phone makers eye wireless Internet opportunity Companies look past current troubles toward growing the mobile data market by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist Worsening economic conditions have caused a major strategic shift in the mobile handset industry. The segment's top companies have begun to de-emphasize phone sales and are eyeing the wireless Internet as a key driver of future revenues. It's no surprise given recent industry performance. Third quarter handset shipments were down by 10% over last year. Motorola's (MOT) sales fell by 22% in the quarter, and Ericsson's (ERICY) phone operations have been so damaging to its bottom line that the company finally moved them into a joint venture with Sony (SNE).

Normal,"COMMENTS DANISH INSURERS As expected yday, Danish regulators reduced the discount rate used to value insurance liabilities from 4.00% to 3.75% despite the fact that the formula called for them to reduce the rate to as low as 3.5%. This marks yet another meeting where the Council reduced the rate by less than what was dictated by the formula and this likely reflects the lobbying pressure being applied by the Danish insurance industry. The attached graph plots the discount rate required by the formula (not the rate chosen by regulators) vs 5y5y EUR vol. It's interesting to note that vol reached it's peak EXACTLY when the discount rate reached its trough. It's also interesting to note how quickly vol sold off when the discount rate rebounded from the 3.50% low (as equities rebounded). Overall, while we suspect there will be some smaller funds feeling some pain with this latest reduction, it's likely much less than the forced buying that we probably would have seen if the rate was reduced by the amount required by the formula. Going forward, it seems the best guide to the performance of long dated vol and cash in Euroland is the overall level of the index. Happy to provide more information on this if you want more clarification. <<dkkvol.doc>> EUR SWAPS One of the quietest days of the year yday as the market rallied and the Tresor was nowhere to be seen. Will be interesting if today's weakness brings them back into the market. Tresor aside, the focus now shifts to an increasing corporate pipeline that will see a 750mm 5y deal from Alcatel, and 500mm 7yr deal from Tomkins, a 5y or 7y deal from Metro, and a 500mm 10y deal from Royal Ahold coming to the market over the next several days. With swap spreads very close to their tightest levels of the year, we've seen little interest in swap spread widening positions & with the Tresor looming and issuance increasing, we suspect spreads will continue on their tightening path for at least the balance of the week. Overall, it seems this week will provide a very good barometer of how the rest of the year will be from a flow perspective as there appears to be little incentive to jeopardize yearly performance (good or bad) by committing large amounts of capital to a market that's been particularly vicious over the past two weeks. EUROPE TRADING VIEW Our overall trading view is to buy on weakness and sell on strength this week. Due to illiqudity and lack of risk capital commitment before year end, and no major economic data to turn the market around, our trading strategy this will likely be BUY AND TRADE, wait until new year, and then BUY AND HOLD. A few other points: * Note that Europe and US have began to sell off at the same time. Based on empirical studies, the simultaneous sell off usually signals a correction, not a prolonged bear market. * 5s in Europe have under performed very sharply relative to the beginning of all previous bear markets. Note that supply in that sector is now behind us, and supply will concentrate in 10 year sector in next two weeks. * Stocks, Bonds and commodities market have all thrown in the towel for a V shape recovery. What's the probability that all three markets are wrong? * MSCI reweightings this week. Our research estimated 4.7 billion out of Eurozone and about 4.2 billion into UK. However, this news is priced in the market in our opinion. If European fixed income sold off because of the reweightings this week, we would fade that trade and go long European fixed income.

Normal,"E-FINANCE Driving Direct CP Issuance New Product Lets Issuers Build Real-Time Market Picture By Susan Kelly Last December, Julie Nickoley, senior manager of commercial paper operations at DaimlerChrysler, agreed to work with Prescient Markets to develop a Web-based subscription technology service to help companies price and manage their commercial paper issuance. The goal: a system to provide real-time flow of short-term prices and a way to track investors and competing issuers. At the time, the global automaker and long-time direct CP issuer saw the possibilities as interesting, but not necessarily a priority. All that changed two months later, when DaimlerChrysler's CP was downgraded to A2/P2. Suddenly, big money-market funds, which once constituted 85% of DaimlerChrysler's market, were no longer buyers. Nickoley had an immediate need to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to take their place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information out of the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance. In October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became available with the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk. Now we know for all customers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do, if they come in through cpmarket or on the phone, says Nickoley. The customer analytics was the key. With the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information on prices, including fluctuations in competitors? CP rates and what investors are looking for in the market on a real-time basis. Funding Desk's pricing module provides short-term market rates from Prebon Yamane and CP rates from cpmarket.com, Prescient?s online platform for direct issuance of CP. In Tune with Market The advantages? Trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into Funding Desk, and Prescient says it is working on a link with Bloomberg that will bring in data on trades done on Bloomberg's CP platform. Companies can save on funding costs by using the data to target less yield-sensitive investors. They can also save money by knowing when competitors move rates and then matching those moves. Using Funding Desk, we're much more in tune to whether pricing is changing in the market, DaimlerChrysler's Nickoley says. Besides cost savings, issuers may simply want to keep tabs on their investors to ensure that no one investor holds too large a chunk, in order to lessen the risk of having to scramble to find other buyers if a big investor exits suddenly. Targeting New Issuers Laurent Paulhac, Prescient's president, won't give the price of Funding Desk, but says it varies based on the size of a corporation's CP program. So far only DaimlerChrysler and ChevronTexaco are using Funding Desk. Paulhac defines the market for Funding Desk as the 500 U.S. companies with more than $1 billion of CP outstanding. About 40 of those companies now sell some or all of their CP directly. But given the ease of electronic issuance and the support available on Funding Desk, Paulhac expects more companies will move toward direct issuance via the Web. In fact, officials at both Prescient and Bloomberg say they were already seeing more interest in their platforms for direct issuance from companies that traditionally placed their CP through dealers - even before Funding Desk's debut. If those companies are going to sell paper directly, they're going to need something on the funding desk or treasury operations side to account and process and transact, says Craig Dukes, North American manager for short-term funding at Ford Motor Credit. Funding Desk is a perfect fit for those people.

De-politicizing the Final Choice PHONY STIMULUS PACKAGE WON'T FIX THE ECONOMY ""Although understandably preoccupied with the war on terrorism, the Bush administration needs to give some leadership to the economy. This means recognizing its own mistakes,"" writes Independent Institute research fellow Paul Craig Roberts, in a recent syndicated column. For starters, Bush should recognize that his tax cuts -- which are phased-in and temporary rather than immediate and permanent -- will do little to stimulate investment. Furthermore, the pork-barrel spending package ""is not a stimulus; it simply crowds out an equivalent amount of private spending and prevents resources from being used more productively,"" writes Roberts. As Roberts says, the so-called ""stimulus"" package ignores the lessons for stimulating long-term growth taught by supply-side economics twenty years ago. ""The solution to the economy's problems is obvious and simple,"" Roberts argues. ""Effective immediately, abolish the alternative minimum tax, accelerate depreciation on a permanent basis and cut tax rates on personal income."" See ""Don't Forget the Economy,"" by Paul Craig Roberts (11/22/01), at For more on fiscal policy, see ""Twenty Years after Humphrey-Hawkins: An Assessment of Fiscal Policy,"" by Jody Lipford (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Summer 1999), at For supply-sider insights on the Reagan era deficits, see ""What Really Happened in 1981,"" by Alan Reynolds and Paul Craig Roberts (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2000), at CRISIS AND RATCHETING UP GOVERNMENT GROWTH The wasteful pork in the recent spending package, and the dubious new anti-privacy powers of the federal government, illustrate clearly how government grows during national crises. Less obvious, however, is the fact that when the emergencies subside, the new programs are seldom dissolved. Often they are transformed into new programs or agencies with new missions, ratcheting up government's growth. The International Monetary Fund is one of thousands of examples that could illuminate this government pathology, explain Independent Institute research fellow Steve Hanke and senior fellow Robert Higgs in a new op-ed for the FINANCIAL TIMES. Formed in 1944 as part of the Bretton Woods agreement, the IMF was intended to stabilize the global financial system -- by providing credit to countries experiencing balance-of-payments problems under the postwar pegged-exchange-rate system. But when President Nixon closed the U.S. gold window in 1971 -- effectively ending the Bretton Woods agreement -- the IMF became a multi-million dollar agency in search of a new mission. It soon found one. The IMF reinvented itself during the oil shocks of the 1970s, and in the 1980s, with President Reagan's seal of approval, by subsidizing loans to developing countries. Today, the IMF is contemplating ways to financially assist coalition partners in the War against Terrorism and to deny funds to less-than-cooperative countries. Government programs and institutions aren't the only things that get ratcheted-up during national crises. ""The ratchet continues to operate on ideology, too,"" write Hanke and Higgs. ""A recent poll conducted by THE WASHINGTON POST indicates that 53 percent of Americans think the government 'is run for the benefit of all the people,' up from 35 percent last year. Only 37 percent agreed that 'the government is pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves,' the lowest percentage since 1966, when 33 percent embraced that view. ""It may be too much to expect a speedy end to the law of the ratchet, but it is time to acknowledge what is going on. That, at least, may make it easier to reverse the trend during times of stability."" See ""Wake Up To the Law of Ratchet,"" by Steve Hanke and Robert Higgs, at Also see: ""When Temporary Economic and Political Measures Become Permanent,"" by Lisa Meyer (TheStreet.com, 10/10/01), at ""Crisis, Bigger Government, and Ideological Change: Two Hypotheses on the Ratchet Phenomenon,"" by Robert Higgs (EXPLORATIONS IN ECONOMIC HISTORY, Vol. 22, 1985), at For more on the ratchet effect, see CRISIS AND LEVIATHAN: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government, by Robert Higgs, at DE-POLITICIZING THE FINAL CHOICE One of the most dramatic battles between federal and state governments -- and a painful illustration of how drug prohibition cripples human dignity -- is brewing in Oregon, where a federal judge recently issued a court order to block U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft from interfering with the state's physician-assisted suicide law. (Declaring that physician-assisted suicide ""was not a legitimate medical purpose for prescribing drugs,"" Ashcroft -- who earier had promised to uphold federalism over federal encroachment upon the states -- had threatened to have the medical licenses of participating doctors revoked.) Many civil libertarians, understandably, see Ashcroft's threat as a direct assault on human dignity in a matter too private and sensitive to allow government interference between doctor and patient. However, according to psychiatrist Thomas Szasz (member, Independent Institute Board of Advisors), the fundamental problem is that our laws make it unlawful to use lethal drugs to commit suicide -- except, as in the case of Oregon, when it is physician-assisted, and even then only under limited circumstances. In other words, no matter how painfully one may suffer from a terminal illness, one's ultimate choice must be prescribed by a physician. Undoubtedly, this needlessly prolongs the suffering and anguish of those law-abiding sufferers who decide that waiting for nature to take its course is too long and too painful. Drug and suicide law reform, however, would help restore genuine dignity to those suffering from unspeakable pain. ""Physician-assisted suicide,"" writes Szasz in a new op-ed, ""is but one of the consequences of our drug laws."" By expanding their range of lawful options, drug and suicide law reform would enable the terminally ill to take matters lawfully into their own hands without interference from the state. It would also help lift the burden from physicians struggling to interpret the Hippocratic Oath. ""The American people are ceaselessly propagandized about the real dangers from which drug prohibitions are intended to protect us,"" Szasz concludes. ""The damage the prohibitions cause are glossed over in silence or, more often, are unrecognized. We avoid confronting problems of living as moral problems and choose instead to treat them as medical problems. It is not a good choice."" See ""Assisted Suicide Is Bootleg Suicide,"" by Thomas Szasz (LOS ANGELES TIMES, 11/23/01), at Also see: ""Beware of Pharmacracy,"" by Thomas Szasz (UPI, 8/21/01), at ""The Therapeutic State: The Tyranny of Pharmacracy,"" by Thomas Szasz (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Spring, 2001), at For more on federalism, see ""Arguments for Federalism,"" by Alex Tabarrok, research director of The Independent Institute, at THE LIGHTHOUSE, edited by Carl P.

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES Stimulus is the key going forward Investors themselves, and not any single outside force, may generate a further market rally. By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies With Thanksgiving smack dab in the middle of the week, it was hard determining what the market wanted to do or where investors' heads were at. After all, the market seemed to be running on empty until the holiday-shortened Friday session, when the market zoomed. Of course, sticking with the engine analogy, nay-sayers will say that the market was just rolling downhill, benefiting from an abbreviated session that saw lighter-than-normal volume. I would agree that Fridays session wasnt an apples-to-apples comparison with regular sessions--it was more like running a soapbox derby racer versus an open-wheel Indy-type car that the market typically runs during a full session. According to those folks that dont believe in the current market rally, Fridays results were amusing and even entertaining, but of no enduring value. It would be easy to write the session off as a day-race that held little value in the grand scheme of things, but that would be a big mistake. In the soapbox derby, gravity draws the homemade racers down a modest hill. The same could have happened to stocks on Friday. Instead stocks climbed up that same modest hill. Stocks defied both gravity and the naysayers by trading higher and higher as the day went on. There is a message in that achievement: I think it tells us that when left to its own devices, the market wants to rally higher. Sure, when there are earnings reports, economic data, brokerage downgrades, wars, unemployment, fear, and warnings from corporate America, the race becomes akin to handling a high-performance race car and turning corners at 180 miles an hour. It isnt as easy as it looks. Click here to read more. 2. INVESTMENT IDEAS Models of success? Surviving Internet players have better business models, but share prices may still be too high for some. By Dave Sterman In a few weeks, 2001 will come to a close, putting the wraps on a forgettable year for the Internet sector. Many firms have already headed for bankruptcy, and other weaker players are also expected to shutter operations later in the winter. But investors are clearly focusing on the eventual winners in the Internet space, as share prices for healthier companies have been soaring in recent weeks. This week, we went looking for net stocks that are still growing and appear firmly in the ""survivor"" category. We specifically looked for Web-oriented companies that are boosting sales at a heady clip. As the accompanying table shows, these stocks have also seen their shares rise sharply, leading to the question: are they still a bargain? Click here to read more.

Normal,"Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions. We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information provides further details about: -- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge; -- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications; -- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; -- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and -- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees. This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC. As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses. Restatement of Earnings Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001. These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position. Here are some details included in the filing: Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments. Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include: -- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997 -- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998 -- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 -- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000 -- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 -- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001 -- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001. The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000. The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001. You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments."

Normal,"Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk. Turret Users An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"". Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors. While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels. The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment. Here's how: Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret. The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.

Normal,"TODAY: Equity research columnist Dave Sterman discusses what investors might take from news concerning network bellwether Cisco (CSCO), John Filar Atwood looks for valuable ideas among the debris of the telecom stock scene, and columnist Ben Mattlin writes about a trio of South Korean telcos. ======================== Sponsored by ========================= Get 10 FREE issues of Investor's Business Daily.

Below --------- Investment ideas Broker reports Sponsored report Investment ideas 1. True value: Strength lurks behind poor valuations Solid historical performance suggests these equipment stocks may continue to provide value in 2002 by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist You really can't blame investors if they would rather just leave the telecom equipment industry alone until 2003. This year, communications equipment shipments fell by 22 percent, the largest single year drop since the 1950s. With capital spending budgets getting slashed for 2002, analysts are forecasting another three percent decline in equipment sales next year. If that happens, it would be first time ever that communications equipment sales dropped in two consecutive years. Investors willing to stick with the industry will have a tough time singling out companies that can provide value under existing conditions. Click here to read more: 2. Outlook 2002: Will price wars scramble wireless? Investors may have to brace themselves, but service may outpace price in customers' values By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist Who'll be the first to blink? Analysts aren't really focused on this issue yet, but price wars may be looming in the wireless sector, scrambling the sector and confounding expectations. Sprint PCS (PCS), Nextel (NXTL), AT&T Wireless (AWE), Verizon (VZ), Cingular (a joint venture between BellSouth (BLS) and SBC (SBC)) and VoiceStream (a unit of Deutsche Telecom (DT)) are close to completing their respective nationwide expansion plans. That means that consumers in almost every major metropolitan area now have at least three or four wireless carriers from which to choose. And that means it won't be too long before these firms start scrambling to poach each other's customers. Unless these carriers can show remarkable restraint, price wars could soon become the dominant theme in the sector.

Hyperlink reference not valid.Y), Extreme Networks (EXTR) and Riverstone Networks (RSTN) have in common? They all sport a market capitalization in excess of $1 billion (despite the massive tech sell-off of the last 18 months), and they all toil in the looming shadow of Cisco Systems (CSCO). Although growth investors continually check the pulse of these other tech upstarts, they can't do research in a vacuum. As goes Cisco, so goes these networkers. To be sure, these companies can try and wrest a few points of market share from Cisco. But if the market for switches and routers doesn't rebound sharply, share gains will result in only a minor revenue uptick. And no one has greater visibility into the direction of the networking market than Cisco. So when Cisco CEO John Chambers speaks, the sector listens. Click here to read more: 4. International wires: Korea advancement Three telcos in Korea are well positioned for long-term growth and attracting analyst interest. By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist A recent report from CLSA Emerging Markets (Dec. 13, 2001) hailed South Korea as ""one of the world's leading telecom markets."" The report cited the rapid growth of both cellular and broadband in this nation of 50 million, and ended with the rhetorical question, ""Isn't it an obvious market in which to be overweight?"" A quick screening of international telcos with an average analyst rating of 2 (""buy"") or better confirms the assertion; in fact, there are three companies passing this screen that are based in South Korea.

Normal,"THE LIGHTHOUSE ""Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy..."" Vol. 3, Issue 51 December 24, 2001 IN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE: 1. Defunct ""Stimulus"" Package Is Uncle Sam's Unintended Gift 2. Ode to John Ashcroft and Civil Liberties 3. A Christmas Reflection 4. More Year-end Giving Tips -- plus a Bonus! Welcome to The Lighthouse, the e-mail newsletter of The Independent Institute, the non-politicized, public policy research organization <http://www.independent.org>. If you know someone who would enjoy THE LIGHTHOUSE, please forward this issue. If they like it, they can add themselves to the list at DEFUNCT ""STIMULUS"" PACKAGE IS UNCLE SAM'S UNINTENDED GIFT Uncle Sam sent taxpayers an unexpected gift last week: an economic ""stimulus"" package that never made it off Capitol Hill. Many economists, critical of the proposed government spending increases, have pointed out that the economy had already started to show signs of recovery anyway. Other critics correctly point out that the ""stimulus"" had enough pork to keep special-interest groups hibernating high on the hog till next winter. There is, however, another reason to have frowned at Washington's ""stimulus"" proposals and to rejoice at their demise. Government ""stimulus"" packages are not, as environmentalists might say, ""sustainable."" They merely crowd out or postpone increases in private investment -- the fuel of economic recovery. And when a government ""stimulus"" is financed by inflation, it tends to undermine the source of that fuel: capital formation. This holiday season we can thank Congress for its inability to agree to ""help"" the economy. But, unfortunately, we're still haunted with visions of Christmas past, when bad legislation has gone back to conference committees only to be return as even worse legislation. Too bad Washington, DC, doesn't have a ""no returns"" policy. For more on the economic benefits of political gridlock, see ""Divided We Stand, United We Fall,"" by Richard Vedder, senior research fellow at The Independent Institute, at Also see, ""Is Macroeconomics Believable?"" by Ben W. Bolch (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Spring 1998), at ODE TO JOHN ASHCROFT AND CIVIL LIBERTIES So long as Americans have freedom of speech, there is hope that the flame of liberty will remain lit. In that spirit, we offer the following ditty posted on the website of The Nonviolence Web. ""Ode to John Ashcroft and Civil Liberties"" (Sung to the tune of ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"") You better watch out, You better not pout, You better not cry. I'm telling you why. John ashcroft's coming to town. He sees you with your lawyer. He listens to every phone; He reads everyone's email, and he locks you all alone. With little tin guns And tiny cellphones Rooty hoot, hoot, he's breaking in homes, Big Brother is coming to town. He knows when you are traveling. He knows who you're around; Tried in military courtrooms, Not a lawyer can be found. He's makin' a list, and checking for race, Gonna arrest those who are dark of face. Big Brother's coming to town. You better watch out, You better not pout, You better not cry. I'm telling you why. Big Brother's coming to town. See Also see: ""Looking Who's Looking,"" by Ron Gurantz, (10/22/01), at ""Watching You: Federal Surveillance of Ordinary Americans,"" by Charlotte Twight (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 1999) ""Conning Congress: Privacy and the 1994 Commuications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act,"" by Charlotte Twight (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2001) A CHRISTMAS REFLECTION Christmas, a holiday rooted in both Christianity and pre-Christian celebrations of the winter solstice, is also an appropriate time to reflect upon the secular values that have helped Western civilization over the course of two tumultuous millennia. Among these values: freedom of conscience, peace on Earth, and goodwill toward men. These values transcend any particular religion; they are in fact articulated in varying degrees by most of the world's religions. Yet they have found their fullest expression in the West. Why? Because in Western culture more than in any other, the individual counts. ""This empowerment of the individual is unique to Western civilization,"" writes Paul Craig Roberts. And it is this individualist precept -- respect for the dignity and worth of each human life -- that holds the key to understanding the unique institutions of the West. The West's individualism, writes Roberts, ""permits an individual person to put his or her foot down, to take a stand on principle, to become a reformer and take on injustice.... It has made the individual a citizen equal in rights to all other citizens, protected from tyrannical government by the rule of law and free speech."" Just as freedom in the West has unleashed in the marketplace the progressive forces of what one economist termed ""creative destruction,"" so freedom in the West has unleashed a similar phenomenon in the marketplace of ideas. This perhaps is the West's supreme paradox (and achievement) -- its tradition of questioning even tradition itself. Concludes Roberts: ""Be we religious or be we not, our celebration of Christ's birthday celebrates a religion that made us masters of our souls and of our political life on Earth. Such a religion as this is worth holding onto even by atheists."" See ""The Greatest Gift,"" by Paul Craig Roberts (12/19/01), at Also see, ""The Drama of Western Identity,"" by David Gress (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Winter 2000) at and ""Freedom of Religion and Public Schooling,"" by James Otterson (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Spring 2000) at MORE YEAR-END GIVING TIPS -- PLUS A BONUS!

INVESTMENT IDEAS It's playing long in Peoria Media issues tend to anticipate a recovery, but some stocks are already over-bought By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies The media group is one that investors should watch very closely over the next several months. These stocks are known as early cyclical issues because their share price usually improves long before the broad economy does. However, other cyclical sectors have actually seen their fortunes turn in anticipation of the economy, while media stocks in general have been sluggish. Last week the big names in the group were downgraded by Credit Suisse First Boston, as much because of internal issues as because of macro conditions. Ad sales on television are now estimated to be off by 8 percent, while only a few weeks ago most industry observers thought the sales number would be off by 5 percent. In fact, for the next couple of months, it is believed that prime time spots for the networks will decrease by 30 percent. Nevertheless, if these stocks live up to their reputation and outperform up to nine months before the broad economy improves, there could be reason to discount the current bad news and look at the group as an intermediate to long- term investment.

Ryan, equity research columnist A handbag manufacturer, a regional health insurer and a used-car dealer make for a motley crew, but they all rank among Wall Street's most- recommended stocks. What all three companies--Coach (COH), WellPoint Health Networks (WLP), and Copart (CPRT)--have in common is a proven ability to grow sales and earnings, especially during downturns. The picks underscore Wall Street's efforts to search across sectors to find clear winners in today's recessionary climate. Click here to read more.

Normal,"COMMENTS PRICE ACTION THIS AM Despite markets trading lower out of the gates on rumors of Bin Laden's capture, customer flows we've seen have been skewed to the buyside. We've had buying of euribor, selling of puts on dec bund futures, and buying of bunds/bobls/schatz on an outright basis. This just feels like a case of the market getting way too bullish way too soon. As for flows, the vast majority of our accounts seem to have taken most of their chips off the table a few days ago though there's obviously some large positions still remaining. While we don't advocate going long just yet as we believe there's potentially another day or two of weakness here, we certainly think it's time to begin to cover shorts and at least contemplate going long again. We don't give much weight to the Bin Laden rumor, fyi. Additionally, I heard two interesting pieces of anecdotal evidence recently - two very prominent business schools (one in the US and one in Europe who usually place at least 95% of their graduates by this time of the year have placed just 50% and 5% respectively of their graduating classes. EUR SWAPS Yet another day of very solid receiving in 10yr swaps. As we mentioned previously, we thought the Tresor would re-enter the market if we weakened again. Well, we did and they did. We estimate roughly EUR2bln 10yrs traded as 10yr swap spreads closed another 1bp tighter on the day. Given where we've opened today, we expect to see more receiving pressure yet again. Additionally, 2/5/10 looks quite convex here at -11bps and we expect to see dealers taking this position off later today - we've already seen one prop account take some off today. On the new issuance front, while the EUR5bln 5y EIB deal will be priced today, it's already been swapped and our best guess is that the continental bank that took down the bobl 138 yday did so against the receiving they've done in the run up to this deal. So today, we expect them to pay in 5yrs vs bobls to get net flat the sector. We also get the EUR750mm deal for Deutsche Bahn later today and while it was supposed to be swapped yday, the rumor is that it was postponed and will likely be swapped in the next day and a half. EUR VOL Vol's been marked down pretty dramatically over the past two days as we closed virtually the entire surface 1 vol lower on the day & 1.5 vol lower on the week. While there was definitely some liquidation in the street, sizes were not that large and clips of 100-150mm were enough to move the market substantially. As liquidity was pretty lousy on the way up, it's no surprise that there's little liquidity on the way down. We've also had a few questions about the skew - ie, if it's being priced less aggressively can we expect to see the Danes come back - but the answer from our guys is that if it's illiquid in the ATM stuff, the OTM stuff is even worse. Having said that, the formula that dictates the rate used to discount Danish liabilities says they now need to use a lower rate (3.50%, down from 4% currently) and if this rate is marked down a further 50bps at the meeting in 2 weeks time, the long end bid to both cash and vol could return. Having said that, if equities continue to grind higher - and our sec lending guys tell us overall short interest is decreasing - the forced selling may not come to fruition.

INVESTMENTOR Stealthy superstars of telecom The three worst international telco equipment companies--or are they? By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist Perhaps it's the Scrooge in me, but for this holiday column let's focus not on attractive or highly rated stocks--where, let's face it, opinions can vary--but on the stinkers, the lemons of international telecom equipment companies that you'd have to be crazy to bet your money on. Or would you? Click here to read more. 2. INVESTMENT IDEAS All eyes on Cisco (CSCO) A plethora of smaller companies are nipping at its heels, but all they may get is bone By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist What do Juniper Networks (JNPR), Foundry Networks (FDRY), Extreme Networks (EXTR) and Riverstone Networks (RSTN) have in common? They all sport a market capitalization in excess of $1 billion (despite the massive tech sell-off of the last 18 months), and they all toil in the looming shadow of Cisco Systems (CSCO). Although growth investors continually check the pulse of these other tech upstarts, they can't do research in a vacuum. As goes Cisco, so goes these networkers. To be sure, these companies can try and wrest a few points of market share from Cisco. But if the market for switches and routers doesn't rebound sharply, share gains will result in only a minor revenue uptick. And no one has greater visibility into the direction of the networking market than Cisco. So when Cisco CEO John Chambers speaks, the sector listens. Click here to read more.

Normal,"COMMENTS EUR SWAPS Flows generally light, with a continuation of the front end receiving action from Tues pm, in both 1y1y and 2yr, albeit in smaller size into the dramatic sell off. Swap spreads broadly tighter led by the front end, with 5yr 1bps & 2yr 1.5bps tighter. Curve flattening on the sell off, 2-10's 2.5bps flatter in swaps, & heading for 5bps flatter in cash, the slack taken up by the extra narrowing in s'end swap spreads. 10-30's 2bps flatter in line with cash curve flattening to leave 30yr spreads broadly unch. 5yr underperforming curve badly, with 2-5-10's fly around 13bps here, there are a few offside posns at these lvls who could well get blown out if we push much further. The market appears to have little appettite for risk at the moment as dealers appear to have been burnt over the larger more prolonged sell-off than expected. Price action and liquidity is very poor so far today. No sign of Tresor in the last day or so, despite higher yields. EUR BONDS Same situation in Eur cash with the 5yr sector destroyed in the downmove with s'end somewhat anchored. Today we have new Eur3.4-3.8bn 5yr btan auction, 3.75% Jan 2007, trading around 5.5bp over the BTAN of July 2006, in the grey market. This is expensive on terms of historical benchmark premium & equates to around even to 138's in swap spread terms & around 4bps rich to July 06 btan in swap psrrad terms. We are pretty indifferent at these lvls & are seeing limited domestic interest, but can see it continuing to trade quite expensive, at least in the short term, due to the equivilent richness in the 5yr deliverable german sector and the scarcity of alternative bonds in the 07 area. We also have the OAT reverse auction today, with OAT 4% Apr 2009, 4% Oct 2009 and 5.5% Apr 2010 will be bought back for a maximum of Eur2bn, with the 7yr sector trashed even more than the 5yr, it makes sense for the tresor to be prepared to pay up a little to buy back still comparatively cheap bonds, but little sense for end clients to tender, altho maybe worth waiting in the tail you might just get filled. EUR VIEWS Financial markets have been keen to anticipate a recovery in global economic activity. But in Europe, things still look bleak. 1.Euroland Q3 is coming in weaker than expected. German GDP was -0.1% in Q3 compared with our forecast of +0.1%. With Italy at +0.1% and the Netherlands at -0.4%, Euroland GDP is unlikely to be better than +0.1%. We will have a more complete picture tomorrow with France (our forecast is +0.25%) 2.The October German Ifo survey was very disappointing, particularly the further marked decline in business expectations from 95.9 in August to 90.5 in September to 89.6 in October. This is one of the best leading indicators of Euroland industrial activity and is one of the three components of the GS leading indicator. Another component - the Belgian manufacturing confidence index is out at 3pm today. 3.Perhaps most worrying of all, our European equity analysts report another deterioration in economic activity in both Euroland and the UK in November (see today's European Daily Comment for details). With few exceptions, our analysts report that economic conditions are still deteriorating or are stabilising at very low levels.

Normal,"COMMENTS EUR SWAPS Another fairly quiet day, with curve steepening from the front end, key flow of the afternoon was one US name receiving in 4bn 1y1y fwd swap, this was relatively well absorbed by the mkt, but aided 2-10's on its 4bps steepening on the day. Flows in long end of curve light with 10-30's broadly unch on the day & 30yr spreads pushing wider by 1bps. GBP Curves disinverting in both gilts & swaps led by the long end on various stories in the mkt, most mentioned is maybe the potential for reforms of annuities, while rumours have been around for a long time, word is building that in the pre budget report there may be a plan to get rid of this. This might also explain the delay of the 2025's tap until the week after the report. Swap spreads broadly unchanged, 10-30's swaps disinverted 3.5bps, with 2-10's swaps unch. UK swap spreads are also increasingly becoming a topic for discussion at these lvls, while we do feel we are starting to reach a support lvl in long end swap spreads, we dont see these levels as an obvious widening opportunity. Generally we do feel that further downside over the coming months in 30yr spreads is probably limited to maybe 5bps or so, and on that basis, it is worth keeping an eye on these and maybe looking to start averaging in soon, but its not clear that the narrowing flows of the last few months are definitely over for the year & while offside risk already in the trade is not significant compared to other flows in the mkt, its certainly out there potentially making this a little crowded going fwd. DKK The Danish election yesterday saw the largest swing since 1968 and reduced the ruling Social Democrats to the second largest party only for the first time in 75 years. The new prime minister will be the leader of the Liberals, Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Together with the Conservatives, the Liberals will begin the work of forming a new government. But this is likely to be a fragile minority government, dependent on shifting coalition partners. The Liberals had hoped to count on the support of the EU-friendly Centre-Democrats but the latter failed to pass the 2% threshold for parliamentary representation. Instead, the right wing Danish Peoples Party emerged to become the third largest party - doubling its mandate. Fogh Rasmussen is going to have a tough job in conquering the middle ground. General elections in Denmark do not ignite much market reaction & this is unlikely to change this time around as the general thrust of the economic policies will not change much, especially on EMU. JPY Bumpy day in Japan, with profit taking by domestics pre auction, then better buying 7-10yr paper, as the new 235's, 1.4% coupon, 1.7trln in size, came at pretty expensive lvls with good customer buying 100.78 ave px, 100.75 low, 100.60/65 area fair value. FOllowing the auction S&P announced Japan downgrade, futures crashed half a point, but mkt bounced back on buying and 7-10's flattened 1.5bps, helped by a strong domestic receiver in 7-10's. Going forward, we see the downgrade impact as pretty limited.

Vol. 3, Issue 44 November 5, 2001 Welcome to The Lighthouse, the e-mail newsletter of The Independent Institute, the non-politicized, public policy research organization <http://www.independent.org>. We provide you with updates of the Institute's current research publications, events and media programs. Do you know someone who would enjoy THE LIGHTHOUSE? Please forward this message to a friend. If they like it, they can add themselves to the list at IN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE: 1. In Defense of Free Speech 2. Antitrust Settlement Bodes Well for Consumers 3. How the FDA Helped Retard Child Development IN DEFENSE OF FREE SPEECH The intimidation campaign against New York radio talk-show personality ""Grandpa"" Al Lewis's website ISP is by no means unique. Recent efforts to suppress the voices of ideological opponents are widespread and not limited to one particular ideology or viewpoint. While ""Grandpa Munster"" drew ire for his outspoken views in opposition to the U.S. government responses to the Sept. 11th atrocities, some on American college campuses have been reprimanded for voicing support for the U.S. military response -- or even for simply displaying American flags, according to Paul Craig Roberts, research fellow at The Independent Institute. ""It is permissible to burn the American flag on university campuses. But don't try waving one,"" writes Roberts in his syndicated column. College administrators on some campuses have ordered the removal of American flags from student dorm rooms and school buses, and banned the staff of a university TV station from wearing red, white and blue ribbons. Some professors have also been demoted or had their websites shutdown. At San Diego State University one Arabic-speaking Ethiopian student was put on warning when he chastised three Arab students he heard ""expressing their delight in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,"" writes Roberts. American colleges and universities were once famous for permitting all forms of speech to be heard in the ""marketplace of ideas."" Too often today we see one form of orthodoxy trying to silence another -- all to the detriment of the spirit of free inquiry and open debate. One need not agree with Noam Chomsky's political leanings to recognize genuine patriotism when he said, ""If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all."" See ""Losing on the Home Front,"" by Paul Craig Roberts, at Also see the transcript of John R. MacArthur's Independent Policy Forum address, ""Censorship and Propaganda in the Gulf War: How Government Can Mold Public Opinion,"" at For more on political correctness in academia, see the Independent Institute book, THE DIVERSITY MYTH: Multicultural Intolerance on Campus, by David Sacks and Peter Thiel, at ANTITRUST SETTLEMENT BODES WELL FOR CONSUMERS Last week's settlement between Microsoft and the U.S. Justice Department is good news for consumers because it does little to hamper Microsoft, according to economist Dominick Armentano, a research fellow at The Independent Institute, in an op-ed published in Canada's NATIONAL POST. The settlement -- still to be approved by the federal judge assigned to the case and several state attorneys general -- would require Microsoft to adopt certain specific operating practices (namely to stop engaging in exclusive dealing arrangements with computer makers, share its Windows source code with competitors, and allow computer makers more freedom to display non-Microsoft software applications). Microsoft, however, has already nearly abandoned its exclusivity arrangements and moved toward an ""open source"" arrangment, observes Armentano. ""In short, the government got virtually nothing from this legal monstrosity of a lawsuit, which is precisely what it deserves,"" Armentano writes. ""Microsoft, on the other hand, is a clear and decisive winner on the issue that first sparked the lawsuit: the tying of its Web browser to its operating system."" Like the antitrust prosecution of IBM in the 1970s and early '80s, the Microsoft antitrust case was without merit, and illustrate the need to fundamentally reform or repeal antitrust policies, according to Armentano. ""Antitrust has a long and sorry history of prosecuting aggressively competitive companies that have innovated rapidly and lowered prices to consumers. And most antitrust 'remedies' attempt to restrain (price) competition -- witness the provision in the Microsoft settlement that requires published rates and uniform discounts -- or make it easier for less efficient firms to do more business. ""Consumers and businessmen need free, open markets and they need protection from force and fraud. They don't need antitrust regulation and protectionism that hampers innovation and harms society,"" Armentano concludes. See ""Microsoft's Big Win,"" by Dom Armentano (THE NATIONAL POST, 11/3/01), Also see ""Settlement is 'a reward, not a remedy,'"" by John Borland (CNET News.com, 11/3/01) For a summary of Dominick Armentano's classic, ANTITRUST AND MONOPOLY (The Independent Institute, 1990), see For a summary of Stan Liebowitz and Steve Margolis's book, WINNERS, LOSERS & MICROSOFT, (The Independent Institute, 2001), see HOW THE FDA HELPED RETARD CHILD DEVELOPMENT When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved two new additives for infant formula, the agency's leaders cheered that the FDA was hard at work to improve children's health. The additives -- DHA and AA, two fatty acids present in breast milk -- play an important role in the development of healthy brains and eyes. Unfortunately, as Alexander Tabarrok, Research Director at The Independent Institute points out, the FDA could have safely approved the additives years ago but didn't. Britain, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands and more than 50 other countries have been using DHA- and AA-enhanced infant formula for years, but this did not help speed up the approval of the infant formula additives in the United States. Consequently, millions of babies have been denied the benefits of 4 more I.Q. points and approximately one line of better vision on a standard eye chart. This horror story is but one example in the long history of FDA over-caution. ""Numerous studies have shown that FDA rules and regulations have resulted in high prices, fewer new drugs, and long delays in getting new drugs to market,"" writes Tabarrok in a recent op-ed. How can the FDA be reformed, so that Americans can enjoy the benefits of pharmaceutical innovation more quickly? ""As a good first step,"" writes Tabarrok, ""the U.S. should establish reciprocity agreements with countries that have a proven record of approving safe drugs -- including most western European countries, Canada, Japan, and Australia. ""If the U.S. and, say, Britain had a reciprocity agreement, for example, then drugs and supplements approved in Britain would gain immediate approval in the U.S., and vice-versa. Such an arrangement would reduce delay, and eliminate duplication and wasted resources.""

Normal,"Italy flirting with recession GDP, flash estimate ?(Q3) Actual: +0.2%qoq, +1.9%yoy UBS Warburg: +0.1%qoq, +1.8%yoy Consensus: +0.1%qoq, +1.8%yoy Previous: Flat qoq, +2.1%yoy Despite a positive help from calendar effects, Italian GDP growth remained at a low 0.1% qoq in Q3. This suggests that, without calendar effects GDP would have contracted slightly. This follows a flat quarter in Q2: Italian economy was thus very close to recession. Although details are not available we believe the weakness of domestic demand and a drag from net trade are the reasons for this weak outcome. We expect similar low numbers in the coming quarters. * The Italian flash estimate showed a slightly higher than expect growth at 0.2%. It does not provide however a breakdown, details will be available with the publication of the final numbers on Dec-20. At this stage, it is thus impossible to assess the drivers of Italian growth. * It is important to remember that, unlike in the other countries, Italian GDP is not adjusted for calendar effects. In Q3 there was two working days more than in Q2 (64 working days against 62). This probably helped to lift slightly the GDP estimate. * Italian GDP gained 0.8% for two quarters in a row in 00Q4 and 01Q1. Details however showed that this was due exclusively to net trade and stocks. Final domestic demand which includes private consumption, investment and public consumption gained only 0.3%qoq on average over these two quarters. This weak pattern was confirmed in Q2 with GDP flat qoq and final domestic demand up only 0.3%. * This pattern is quite worrying as we expect net trade to contribute negatively to growth in the future. Italy will have to rely exclusively on domestic demand. ISTAT said that it expected Q4 growth to be 0.1-0.2% in Q4. We are more pessimistic as we expect a contraction of 0.1%.

Normal,"The fall in French job creation stabilises Non farm payrolls (Q3) Actual: +0.3%qoq,+2.4%yoy UBS Warburg: Flat qoq,+2.1%yoy Consensus: +0.1%qoq,+2.2%yoy Previous: +0.3%qoq,+3.1%yoy Non farm payrolls are clearly a good surprise as we expected the growth rate to continue to plummet. However, the fall in labour productivity and the results from surveys lead us to believe that employment growth will continue to slow. This underpins our pessimistic scenario for Franc in the coming months. * Non farm payrolls are better than expected. But, after a 1.0% qoq growth recorded in Q4 last year, 0.8% in Q1 and 0.3% in Q2 and Q3 job creation is much less dynamic. * The number also show that the sharp increase in unemployment was partly due to an unusually high dynamism of the labour force on the wake of the suppression of the military service. * During the first two quarters of the year, job creation was faster than GDP resulting in a fall in labour productivity. With growth expected at 0.3% in Q3, non farm payrolls suggest that France could register a third (marginal) fall in labour productivity. This calls for a correction. Job creation growth could fall quicker in the coming quarters. * Job growth was essentially driven by the service sector. Since 1995, more than 95% of the new jobs were created in that sector. The deceleration also comes from this sector. After a growth pick at 1.2%qoq in 00Q4, growth was only 0.5 % in Q3 this year. This is hardly a surprise given, for instance, the sharp decline in temp agency work.

Normal,"Decline in euro area HICP inflation confirmed Euro area headline HICP inflation (October) Actual 2.4% UBSW 2.4% Consensus 2.4% Previous 2.5% Euro area core HICP inflation (October) Actual 2.3% UBSW 2.3% Consensus 2.2% Previous 2.2% Bottom line: Euro area headline inflation decelerated as expected to 2.4% in October from 2.5% due to energy prices. This is in line with consensus expectations and the ""flash"" estimate published by Eurostat earlier in the month. Euro area core inflation (CPI less all food and energy) accelerated to 2.3% in October from 2.2% in September. This was above initial consensus estimates of 2.2% but probably widely expected following preliminary French and German national CPI data which indicated higher core inflation. The rise in core inflation is clearly an issue for the ECB but we would expect them to play down the acceleration in core inflation and focus instead on the fall in headline inflation. Headline inflation was 2.0% or below in 4 economies in October, up from 3 in September. The ECB expects headline inflation to decelerate sharply during early 2002 - the recent declines in oil prices, if sustained, are likely to add to that sentiment. We expect slower growth leading to lower pipeline inflation pressures along with base effects to generate firm expectations of a marked decline in inflation during 2002. This underpins our expectation of a further 50bp of policy rate cuts from the ECB in Q1 2002."

Normal,"Italian inflation's decline continues City CPI (November) Actual: +0.2%mom, +2.4%yoy UBS Warburg: +0.2%mom, +2.4%yoy Consensus: +0.1%mom, +2.3%yoy Previous: +0.2% mom, +2.5%yoy Italian inflation continues its steady downward trend. This will go on. Producer prices inflation is falling even faster than CPI inflation. Moreover, wages remain muted, increasing slower than inflation this year. With the ongoing weakness of domestic demand all ingredients are thus in place for further fall in inflation. * Based on the city CPI, we see Italian prices up 0.2% in November (possibly only 0.1%), and inflation is likely to lose a further decimal point at 2.4% (possibly 2.3%). If confirmed, this would be the seventh consecutive fall in inflation and the lowest level of reached since April 2001. * We see inflation down in the coming months. The decline in domestic demand will create more spare capacity, and the fall in commodity prices will also help. Underlying pressures should thus unwind helping core inflation down. * The breakdown suggest that the transportation sector register a large fall in prices. This is the direct effect of falling oil prices. Despite the removal of the tax credit on fuel, gasoline prices have indeed declined. Data also provide some evidence that food prices are also receding to a more normal level.

Normal,"French consumption: the winter of discontent Household manufacturing consumption (Oct) Actual: -0.4%mom, +3.0%yoy UBS Warburg: +0.2%mom, +4.3%yoy Consensus: -0.2%mom, +3.9% yoy Previous: -0.1%mom, +4.3%yoy October consumption data are clearly disappointing, not only because consumption contracted but also because previous numbers were revised significantly down. Moreover, taking out the large positive impact from car consumption, numbers look even weaker. We think the bad performance of the labour market is eventually taking a toll. We expect the fourth quarter to remain very weak in terms of consumption. * The monthly decline in consumption is quite severe, but it is important also to note that September growth was revised to -0.1% while the original number was +0.2%. * Car consumption is in line with preliminary information (+0.8% mom, +11.1%yoy) but this is balanced by a very weak retail sector (-0.5%mom, +0.9%yoy). Hence the underlying trend, without the car effect, is even weaker than what is suggested by headline numbers. * Numbers in Q3 were buttressed by the employment premium which was paid to low income people. But the underlying trend, with the sharp deterioration of the labour market, is a negative for consumption. We remain very pessimistic about the short term prospects of the labour market. Hence we believe the consensus is still too high. St?phane D?o Economic Research UBS Warburg Tel : +33 1 48 88 30 36 Fax : +33 1 47 63 48 08 Mob : +33 6 76 85 33 18 Stephane.deo@ubsw.com"

INVESTMENT IDEAS Better safe than sorry In an insecure world, Corporate America is investing in security software By Carla Drysdale If you're like me, a ""virus warning"" in your email inbox isn't likely to faze you. You click on it and glance through it, with a vague sense of gratitude that the warning will hopefully prevent your computer from imploding. So at first I took it in stride when I received a message saying: ""If you receive an email entitled 'Bad Times,' delete it IMMEDIATELY. Apparently this one is pretty nasty."" I thought, okay, and I kept reading. ""It will not only erase everything on your hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks within 20 feet of your computer...It will do all your drugs and drink all your liquor."" Now that's a nasty virus! While this science fiction scenario might have been written by someone who's seen The Matrix once too often, it is a tongue-in-cheek reminder that smart hackers can wreak all kinds of havoc. Fortunately for the makers of anti-virus software, Fortune 100 companies are acutely aware of the problem, and they are keeping security software firms busier than ever--and that makes them an attractive target for private equity as well.

Consumers came to the rescue of retailers, and individual investors will come to the rescue of the street. by Charles Payne, founder, chief executive officer and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies Last week saw a marked contrast to the previous week as the Northern Alliance went from the Keystone Cops to a liberating rebel force, pushing the Taliban back on their heels (or on their toes, as they scatter to caves and tunnels in the southern part of Afghanistan). Wall Street mavens and the media suggested that stocks were pushed higher by the war victories, and while I agree that the prospect of a short war is a positive element for the market, I believe that the week's success had some domestic ingredients as well. In fact, I think the most telling moment of the week came when retail sales figures were released last Wednesday, once again beating expectations. In the previous week, many observers were surprised to see that consumer sentiment (as monitored by the Michigan survey) came in well above estimates, and was quickly dismissed as some type of fluke. After last week, though, I dont think anyone can question the resolve of the American consumer.

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES Advent Software (ADVS) What can you say about a tech stock that analysts tout even while estimates drop? How about: Nice! By Marc Gerstein Usually analysts like stocks when earnings are growing, and they are most bullish on shares of companies whose earnings growth is especially strong. That's a major reason why tech stocks have been in the doghouse lately. Earnings have been heading south. Whether or not you want to invest in tech now generally depends on how patient you are. If you're willing to get in early and wait until earnings recover and estimates get revised upward (something that will probably be occurring around mid-2002), this is a great time to jump in. If you're not so patient, you have to agonize trying to guess the timing of recovery. Click here to read more. 2. INVESTMENT IDEAS From Russia with love A troika of telecom stocks that are well-positioned for current trends and gaining analyst esteem. by Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist When shares of Russian-based telecom companies start earning a measure of analyst esteem, savvy investors owe it to themselves to take a further look. To be sure, these three Russian telcos haven't yet attained analysts' highest rating, but quite surprisingly--and seemingly out of nowhere--each has an average rating better than a neutral 3, and one of them has moved up to an average rating of 2 (""buy"").

Normal,"As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend. ? Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16. All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved. If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive. As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on. ? Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM. Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack. (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.) NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday. o Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees ? Security & badges - All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting. Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group. If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times. No one will be allowed access without their badge. If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring. ? Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in. o Red - Move Team o Orange - Desktop Support/IT o Green - Telephony ? Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06. It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor. It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers. If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116). ? Move boxes - Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4 boxes per person. ? Move labels - If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed. ? Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday. If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled. . Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water. The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor. We would also like to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations. ? Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both. Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know. Thanks so much for all your help and hard work. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01. Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move. T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd"

Normal,"Folks: John and Sireesha have just pushed to staging a bunch of enhancements / bug fixes / new features. Included in them are: 1. Configurable Questionnaire 2. Invitee Lists Part I (this does NOT include the upload of the contact lists) 3. User Statistics 4. Fix for the Issuing Entity 5. Auction security fix 6. Auction enhancements Part I 7. Rewrite of the view deal page impacting permission levels in EVERY domain 8. The Adapter for the User Registration piece (this should be seamless to the user, but be happy that this change ELIMINATES message brokers from this process) 9. Various bug fixes including those relating to view closing etc. The remaining auction enhancements are planned to be pushed sometime early next week. I would recommend everybody spend some time testing next week and reflect their comments / suggestions to John and I. The location of the test site is: You also need to establish new IDs and passwords (since your production IDs and Passwords will not work!). The admin ID and password (if you need to approve users and deals to test them are - ID: jspitz; Pwd: pass).

Normal,"Pushkar I quickly plotted the short and the long curves and the following come out in your face. 1. Is this policy easing going to be a one shot ( a la 98 ) followed by a quick pick up in economic activity, or is this going to be a more deeper situation. That is the big one. The curves vote for a small road-bump which will be rectified by a couple of eases over the next 6 months. Something the Fed can handle easily and quickly. This is most likely NOT going to happen - this is not a 98 and things are going to play out differently. There are a number of other possibilities. 2. The current slow-down is two pronged - capital spending slowdown from businesses ( especially on IT with the internet bust ) and the consumer spending slow-down , possibly because of the stock market wealth effect. Both of these have already hit the durable goods section. This reversal is 'Real' which takes longer to turn then the 'Financial crisis' hence there is good possibility we see a protraction of this weakness and even coupled with the fed eases this is going to take longer than six months to get better. 3. The new administration is going to take this as a good opportunity to force tax cuts. How does the Fed look at those ? Will the Fed balk and be less aggressive in the rate cuts expecting the tax cuts , will it ignore them. That makes the equation harder. It also to some extent argues that longer term rates go up if these tax cuts materialize. But on the shorter term who that effects Fed policy will have profound effect on the curve. All these favor a steeper curve. The 2-5 at -23 ( -6 on swap curve ), 2 -10 at -15 ( 18 on the swaps ) and 2-30 at 19 bps ( 37 bp) should all be steeper as market realizes the length of this ease cycle. If this cycle lasts an year ( the final and the last ease happens next Dec ) then the 2-10 should be 40 bp positive, as the market realizes that."

I would like to introduce myself and my company. Kalahari Ltd is a UK based software company that has for the past 14 years been supply pricing software to the Financial Markets. Over the past year we have been branching out into the energy markets and are currently working for a number of UK based Electricity companies. One such company (London Electricity) has asked us to produce software to filter and highlight online trading prices. This allows them to see ONLY the best price in the market for any one product at a time. This is due to the sudden explosion of internet based price delivery systems. To enable us to acieve their requirements we require an API to the relative online trading systems. Today I spoke to a gentlemen in your call centre who gave me your contact details.

From: Alex Heath @ ECT 26/01/2001 12:30 To: Enron Metal & Commodity - UK traders, Enron Metal &Commodity - Global Traders, Enron Metals Global a/es, Enron Metals lme Dealers, Enron Metals London A/E's, Enron Metals ORIGINATION TEAM, ENRON METALS SCRAP GROUP, ENRON ONLINE MKTG cc: Subject: ENRON METALS WEEKLY REVIEW Enron Metals Weekly Review Good evening ...one and all . It hardly seems possible that we are another week on already such has been the pace of activity here . The ebb and flow in the Ali market both in the spreads and outright price have kept our valiant dealers on their toes as seemingly the whole market vies to avail itself of our pricing and liquidity services on-line ! . Daily volumes have continued to grow with over 800 separate transactions being seen today! . In fact volumes have risen by approximately 56% since December from a daily average of 357 to a daily average of 557 for January .At the same time the regular Non-EOL transaction count has decreased from about 1800 trades a day to 1586 trades since December. Your efforts at getting the registered customers who had not completed an on line trade are beginning to pay dividends finally - but the migration remains painfully slow . Keep plugging away The graph above illustrates the growth of our average daily online transaction volumes in relation to our regular transaction volume on a monthly basis from July of 99 to date . This week's daily transaction volume is another record and but for the blip on Monday which put down to the Mother's day in Africa holiday would have been sensational . We have asked for your response to several queries over the past three weeks and have received little or no reaction. Consequently we shall ask again. Currently at the top of the list: if each of you could create a list of Metals Conferences you believe would be beneficial for Enron metals to attend, speak at and/ or have metals or EnronOnline presence, it would be greatly appreciated. This is a multi faceted sales and marketing tool for your benefit . Aside from the overall goal of creating a unified metals marketing plan, we are also trying to prepare a budget to assure that proper attention and funds are given Enron metals Global exposure in 2001 . Therefore, if we do not receive your recommendations well in advance we will not be in a position to sponsor them . We have created a conference listing which will be circulated next week . Please add to it if we have missed any off . and mark onto our list those you think should have our attention . For those of you that missed it last week, we have attached another copy of the Account Application Form. The completion of this form for BOTH traditional and online customers will speed your client's access to trading with Enron Metals. The lack of contributions for this review from any of you is rather disappointing . We will continue to offer you items that you may find of use . However the purpose of this review is also to incorporate content from around the network of our global field offices. I know you are all very busy making money for the cause . This medium is a useful platform to get your message over . For those of you not on the circulation lists see the attached reports The Metals Crammer report The daily Options report Whilst not exactly a feature we thought it might be a useful exercise in client relationship damage limitation to explain what happens when a customer finds he cannot trade on line .This has begun to occur more regularly as our volumes and activity increase. Customers are allocated a credit line for EOL within the system based upon their agreements. This limit is set daily as a default against the clients name . basis the AS400 's net valuation of the client's position . The amount of available variation credit on the client's account on EOL is set as his limit f or the next days trading . If the client should trigger this limit during the next day's trading the system will reject the trade and lock out the customer . Not very user friendly as the customer is not told why . London credit (Hamish's team) get a red flag , as of course do the traders running the stack managers as they see the trade rejected. The problem now becomes one of frustration for the customer as the system will not allow him to liquidate his position either in part or whole .He will have to pick the phone to do this . Secondly the resetting of any limit in the system takes 48hrs . This is being worked on but we must remember that Metals are the only futures products on the system and the other OTC products on the system are dealt with differently . It also serves to highlight that clients with small credit lines in the 1 to 200,000 dollar range are not really suited to use EOL . Security such as g/tees and cash are taken into account but can be missed ,but forward profits are as it is net availability that is used on the AS400. This will all improve with the introduction of a new bridge between the Enron risk system and the AS400 in the very near future . In the meantime it will be up to you to keep the peace and explain to your clients . Get them to keep within their limits . Call them quickly when they get locked out. Remember, we are here to help your efforts and help create positive communication lines between our offices world-wide. So, send us your thoughts, questions, concerns, local area market news etc. We will look forward to hearing from you.

Normal,"Dear Mr. Arora: I wanted to thank you for taking the time to interview me this past Wednesday. I enjoyed meeting you and other representatives of the company and left our interview with a much greater understanding of what drives Enron and what the company seeks in its applicants. Your responses to my questions only confirmed my already high opinion of the company. As you know, I am a first year student at Owen concentrating in Finance and Electronic Commerce. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Bentley College in May of 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics & Finance, and I received an Honors Certificate in Economics from the University of Cambridge in August of 1995. After graduating from Bentley, I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as an analyst in its Financial Development Program. Most recently, I worked as an investments analyst for Thomson Financial, where I evaluated three major business development initiatives and five acquisition proposals totaling $44 million and worked with senior management on a takeover bid for one of Thomson's key competitors. I also performed strategic, market, and competitor analysis, and proposed ways of improving the organization's overall competitiveness. My professional experiences working in the High Technology and Financial Information Services industries have led to a complete redefinition of my career goals. I much prefer to be on the front lines of business, helping some of the world's most established organizations make decisions that will impact their financial future and competitive position in the market. I am anxious to begin my career with Enron and believe that a relationship with company would prove mutually beneficial. In closing, I would like to thank you again for interviewing me in Nashville. If you have any questions, please contact via e-mail at or at (615) 673-0329. Have a wonderful week! Best Regards, Ajay S. Jagsi"
Normal,"Here is my summary of our second round summer interviews. Top 3 candidates below. 1. Craig - Well rounded, Military background, excellent leadership experience (aircraft carrier pilot), did not have a finance background, but performed very well on Harry's analytical interview. Very personable, confident and sold himself well. I think he is very interested in Enron and would likely accept. 2. Victor - He was a strong candidate in my more subjective interview, but I didn't think he was quite as strong as Ajay. However he outperformed Ajay in the analytical interview. With that feedback from Harry I feel comfortable placing Victor ahead of Ajay. Also very interested in Enron. 3. Ajay - Very polished, presented/sold himself very well, Excellent understanding of Enron's business (did his homework), Relative to others based on my interview he ranked in the top 2, However did not perform as well as others in the top 4-5 in the analytical interview. For this reason I'd push him back to number three. Aside from these three there were two others that are worth discussing. Casey Jones Andrew Rosenberg We Understand these two may have outstanding offers from firms that they are very interested in. I would not consider either of these two ahead of Craig, but might place Casey ahead of Victor. However I think Casey is least likely to accept the offer. My suggestion would be to make offers to Craig & Victor, then consider a 3rd offer to Andrew, recognizing we would likely get a maximum of 2/3. Lee Jackson"

Please let me know if you would like further information. - Dan -----Original Message----- From: Elrod, Hal Sent: Friday, February 02, 2001 2:53 PM To: Bruce, Dan Cc: Hillier, Bob; Spitz, John Subject: DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution Importance: High Event Sequence ? Lot 1 of two Sabre auctions went through without issues ? Between Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval. About 10 minutes into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on the View Deal page. Within minutes, users reported the same problem reentering the Sabre deal. The rest of the site was unaffected ? Within five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management subsystem of DealBench. Solution Attempts: ? Restart the process that returns documents ? Move the documents off the deal Solution: ? Create a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the documents. ? The auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late. Once started, it continued without further errors through several auction extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre. Cause ? Document management process stopped returning documents and was instead returning null values. This caused the View Deal page to appear ""hung"". The Document to be served was the ""deal agent logo"", a special document type that is displayed at the top of the page. Contributing Factors ? The run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, was not logging its status ? The SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly handle the special case of a document file being moved. Therefore, moving the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error. ? run.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running consistently for over 60 days. Therefore it was not initially suspected as a problem source. Fixes ? An immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system stability has been addressed ? Isolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly test all possible failure scenarios. ? Start logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process ? Make document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in the event of error ? Increase monitoring on new log files ? Initiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to identify further areas to improve system robustness"

Normal,"Kira- I got your name (and email address) from Chad Muir and was hoping to arrange a time to briefly (and informally) talk to you about Yahoo's B2B business strategy and whether you think there might be any opporunities to discuss some strategic relationship between Yahoo and Enron Net Works's DealBench subsidiary. Without getting into too many details, DealBench is an ASP addressing the needs of large, secure, sophisticated transaction participants. We are currently offering live online auctioning capabilities, online virtual datarooms and certain deal areas for the syndication of bank products and lease portfolios. We have completed transactions with nominal value of over $4 Billion since launching the site 4 months ago. My initial thought is that this could potentially fit in nicely with what I believe is Yahoo's need for recurring transaction-based revenues in certain B2B areas. Hopefully we can find time to talk soon. Take care, Jeff Jeffrey M.

Normal,"Hi all, I just wanted to sum up our discussions from yesterday. Enron Global Assets is considering using DealBench for hosting virtual datarooms for the divestiture of 32 international assets. The projected total number of documents will be in the region of 3500. DealBench has offered to host these datarooms at a cost of $25k per dataroom. This is on the basis that you are hosting all 32 datarooms, as we have worked some steep discounts into the pricing. The term of the dataroom hosting services under this offer is for the year 2001. We have also offered to help with the transition of the data to the improved dataroom platform once that is in place sometime in Q2. You have mentioned that a few documents that you intend to upload are bigger than 8MB. We have discussed that we can lift the current file size ceiling to greater than 8MB. I just want to make you aware that for users of the platform with slower connections it will be extremely time consuming to download these files. Even under ideal circumstances it will take al least 5 minutes for a 15MB file to download. For users with slower connections it will potentially seem like the download has failed, even though the download is still in progress. This could result in a lot of calls to you and our help-desk. As I mentioned it might be of value to you to have professional assistance with the conversion of your paper documents to PDF. We are working together with a company in Houston that could help in the conversion process. From our experience file size and quality of scans are greatly improved by outsourcing this function. This is especially true if one is performing an OCR process on the TIFF files during conversion to PDF. In the light of the urgency of your projects it might be a good idea to start the dataroom preparation process as soon as possible. May I ask why you suggested to wait until March to get back in contact with us ? If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at 713-345-4147. We are very excited in helping you to deliver a world class solution. Thanks Tobias Munk"

Later on, the day I was to leave, I asked my mom and she told me you had called - so not only did I not see you while I was there - I managed to not call you back. How are things coming along ? Hows family ? Hope business is going well. Email me when you get a chance. Harry Do You Yahoo!? Yahoo! Auctions - buy the things you want at great prices http://auctions.yahoo.com/"
Normal,Hi Vijay Havent spoken to you in the last couple of months. I was in India in March for about 10 days - I was in Delhi to see my parents (right around Holi) - I tried hard calling you but could not get through your number. Unfortunately I did not have your parents home number on me. I am hoping next time I could visit you all in Daman. What else is going on ? Hows job ? Hows Monika and Kartikeye ? What do you think about these latest market sell offs ? (till the last couple of days) I dont know if I gave you the latest on my end. In March I moved back from the ecommerce group into the energy trading. I am running the options trading for East Power trading. It is inherently interesting market. The wholesale market is divided into 10 or so hubs where you have good transmission connectivity and it trades for time blocks like each month and further divided into each hour. Its the market process extended to one end. Hope every one is well in family. Write me when you get a chance. Harry Do You Yahoo!? Yahoo!

Now, more than halfway through the fourth quarter, the venture capital market is still far from robust. Where will it go from here and which will be the startups that drive VC investments in 2002? For the moment, venture capitalists are putting most of their money into saving existing businesses, rather than starting new ones. According to data from VentureWire, a division of New York-based Technologic Partners, halfway through the fourth quarter, seed money and first-round financing accounted for just 12 percent of all disbursements, down from 25 percent in the first quarter.

INVESTMENT IDEAS The decade ahead for e-business Sell-side solutions may be the wave of the near-term future By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer At the Line56 conference held recently in New York, one of the most upbeat perspectives on the future of e-business came from Tom Thomas, current CEO and chairman of Haht Commerce, and former CIO of Dell Computer (DELL) during the 1990s. Taking the long-term view of e-business over the next decade, Thomas compared the current economic climate in 2001 to that of 1991--a time when the United States was in the middle of a recession, but at the beginning of a decade when the deployment of new technologies would bring immense opportunity for growth.

INVESTMENT IDEAS Broadband goes mainstream That sound you hear may be media finally streaming and screaming through fat pipes By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist Who needs a race car when the local speed limits are 10 miles per hour? That was the lesson learned by many Internet-oriented business models that delivered services geared towards high-speed access, only to find that most surfers were still connected to the Web by a dowdy 56K dial- up modem. The promise of (high-speed) broadband connections has been so slow to materialize that many start-ups ran out of cash before ever garnering a large audience. Entire sectors, such as Web-based animation, have come and gone. But just as the hype has cooled, it now looks like the promise of broadband may finally be realized as we head into 2002. Penetration rates are rising again, and could soon reach the critical mass necessary to make broadband a mainstream technology. Roughly 10.7 million U.S. households now have broadband access, representing about 16 percent of all households online, according to research firm the Yankee Group. That's up some 60 percent from 12 months ago. Click here to read more.

Normal,"Hi All: Just got off the phone with the folks @ Dominion regarding some indicative pricing I gave them last week for (i) a 7000 Heat Rate Call in TVA; and, (ii) a 7000 Heat Rate Call in SERC. FYI, I had quoted the TVA Call @ $3.97/KW-mo ($1 over our mid) for a 4yr call beginning 1/1/03 with $2 VOM and 5x16 avail with 16hr mins. I also quoted the SERC 7000 call at $1 over our mid, at $3.98/KW-mo for 1 yr and $4.12/KW-mo for 4 yrs, again with 5x16 and 16 hour mins. The good news is --- this pricing generated some interest. The other (not bad) news is, they want us to refine our quotes in some respects. For the SERC calls, they're really interested in the new RTO GridSouth. Harry, we need to see if we can identify a product today for what GridSouth will be tomorrow. In addition, they are really interested in something more akin to a true synthetic, with intraday availability, say 2-3 hour notice with 4 or 8 hour mins. (Since they are going to compare this to a real plant, I think we can take some latitude in calculating the VOM for shorter dispatch periods, since they would otherwise experience a start charge which would be spread over fewer hours). Let me know what you think we can do. We should probably talk about this. On the TVA call, they're happy with the quote I gave them, but would like the flexibility of 8 hour mins. Let talk about this, as well. I told them that size on the TVA would be in the range of 200-250. They will check size on their side and I'd like us to affirm if this works for us, as well. They would also like to see a Peaker Call in TVA with a June'04 start, 3-yr term, 4 hour notice, 4 hour mins, priced for Jun-Aug and Dec-Mar availability. They'll get back to me on size. In the meantime, let's talk about what we're interested in. Sorry about the length of this message. If I don't hear from you in an hour or so, I'll initiate the call. My NY number is 212-715-5953."
Normal,"The exact location is Lakewood LMP. There is a substation at Lakewood. Plant location is 55 miles south of New York City on an exit ramp of the Garden State Parkway. To my knowledge, the existing plant is not interconnected to NY. In any event, pricing would be for PJM East. -----Original Message----- From: Arora, Harry Sent: Monday, November 05, 2001 5:07 PM To: Blair, Greg; Cavazos, Brandon Subject: RE: Con-Ed - Lakewood New Jersey Synthetic Peaker What is the exact location (in terms of LMP) - is this a PJM east or PJM west hub ? Is it connected to NY, either Zone G or Zone J ? -----Original Message----- From: Blair, Greg Sent: Monday, November 05, 2001 3:56 PM To: Cavazos, Brandon Cc: Arora, Harry Subject: RE: Con-Ed - Lakewood New Jersey Synthetic Peaker Brandon and Harry: Brandon: I assume the pricing is at the mids. Also, since the spread between the 1.50VOM and the 3.00VOM is so small, I'll just quote the 1.50. Harry: Please look at the entire email thread (to get a sense of all the metrics we're employing for this quote). ConEd has already announced a 3x7FA peaker configuration for Lakewood, NJ. The site is already owned by ConEd, part of an existing 230MW combined cycle plant they already own. It's on the same transmission line (running to the south) as the Oyster Creek nuclear facility, which has a license expiration in 2009. The existing plant is a non-merchant EWG, selling 215MW to JCP&L pusuant to a twenty-year PPA expiring in 2014. ConEd has put out an RFP to sell 200-250MW of the peaking capacity from this planned facility. They planned to have the unit operational by June 2002. If we provide this synthetic toll, the plant construction would be deferred. Let me know if we can do 350 to 500MW and let's talk about appropriate spreads above the mids. Also, please be mindful of their desire for 8 hour mins. Thanks -----Original Message----- From: Cavazos, Brandon Sent: Monday, November 05, 2001 4:38 PM To: Blair, Greg Cc: Hiemstra, Nick Subject: FW: Con-Ed - Lakewood New Jersey Synthetic Peaker Pricing as follows: For the 3 year option: $1.50 VOM - $1.77 $3.00 VOM - $1.69 For the 4 year option: $1.50 VOM - $1.74 $3.00 VOM - $1.66 As always, these prices are indicative. For a product of that size (350-500MW), I would probe the customer to find a break-even/cost of construction price, and approach Harry to get the risk premium.

Normal,"Harry, Iris and Brandon: I asked ConEd if they were prepared to hear our OFFER to buy peaking capacity from the Lakewood expansion. They are ""in the midst of preparing a draft term sheet for purchasing the output/tolling"" so we'll have to wait to see the parameters of sale. I also asked if they would like to see PJM WEST synthetic toll offer from us. Unfortunately, NO. To the extent it matters, the on-line date is now set for late 2002, so they would like to see our offer for a Jan '03 start date. Given that these guys are doing a real comparison against bricks and mortar, we would be looking at a $63 million option premium for 500MW @ 3.50/KW-mo over a three-year term; $84 million for a four-year term, I would hope we could be able to find a way to hedge the risk of too many $500 hours killing us. Is there any cap we could buy to protect our downside risk here and still make this deal attractive? The heat rate call is struck at 10,900!"

Normal,"Harry and Brandon: Just to memorialize what I just communicated to Harry over the phone. My interface at TVA emailed yesterday requesting a phone dialogue to discuss where our Synthetic Peaker offer needs to be for TVA to execute. Holding all assumptions constant, we would need to come in between $2.25-$2.30/KW-month in order for TVA to execute. Our indicative quote was $3.90/KW-month. I will attempt to find out if they have other offers in the sub-$2.50 range or if they are just setting their own bid at the requested price."
Normal,"8214 Colonial Oaks Lane Spring, Texas 77379 December 20, 2001 Mr. Harry Arora Regarding: energy trading positions I am writing to you to express my desire to be apart of the Wholesale Power and Gas Trading operation that will potentially be created with an entity that has a high credit rating. I have been working for Rogers Herndon in Enron Wholesale Services on the Options Desk. In this role I have modeled the power options that are embedded in the various deals done through Enron Energy Services with large industrial and commercial clients. In addition, I profitably managed the positions and priced deals for structurers and originators. I realize that now is a difficult time but am confident that I would make an excellent addition to your team for several key reasons: ? Proven experience in the financial markets and direct trading experience in various markets, including electricity and natural gas, mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign exchange, EuroCurrency and EuroDollar deposits ? Team player and high work ethic, successfully balancing trading opportunities with managing risk ? Solid portfolio management and risk management experience in electricity and mortgage banking ? Five years direct experience in trading, risk management, structured products and marketing of electricity for the United States ? Actively involved in the physical markets and strong understanding of the western grid ? Experience trading OTC forwards and options at major hubs in other NERC regions such as Cinergy, Entergy, ERCOT, NEPOOL and PJM ? Worked for both unregulated power marketers and regulated utility ? Extensive experience in derivatives and structured products ? Ability to effectively work with marketers pricing and structuring deals for industrial and commercial end users of energy ? Strength in mentoring junior traders Thank you, Rick J. Wurlitzer Home: (281)251-6210, Work: (713)853-5049 E-Mail: Home: r.wurlitzer@att.net <mailto:r.wurlitzer@att.net>, Work: rwurlitz@enron.com"
